In ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', every act of magic distorts the equilibrium of the world, which in turn has far-reaching consequences that can affect the entire world and everything in it. As a result, competent wizards do not use their magic frivolously.<ref name=\"Kern\"/>\n\nIn Terry Pratchett's ''Discworld'' series, the Law of Conservation of Reality is a principle imposed by forces wanting wizards to not destroy the world, and works to limit how much power it is humanly possible to wield.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Whatever your means, the effort put into reaching the ends stays the same. For example, when the wizards of Unseen University are chasing the hapless wizard Rincewind in the forest of Skund, the wizards send out search teams to go and find him on foot. The Archchancellor beats them to it by using a powerful spell from his own office, and while he gets there first by clever use of his spell, he has used no less effort than the others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Names and terminology==\nPeople who work magic are called by several names in fantasy works, and terminology differs widely from one [[fantasy world]] to another. While derived from real-world vocabulary, the terms ''wizard'', ''witch'', ''[[warlock]]'', ''enchanter/enchantress'', ''sorcerer(ess)'', ''druid(ess)'', ''magician'', ''mage'', and ''magus'' have different meanings depending upon context and the story in question.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|619}}\n\nThe term ''archmage'', is used in fantasy works as a title for a powerful magician or a leader of magicians.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|1027}}\n\n===Reasons for distinguishing magicians===\n[[File:The Love Potion - Evelyn de Morgan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|''[[The Love Potion]]'' by [[Evelyn De Morgan]] (1903)]]\n\nIn the ''[[Enchanted Forest Chronicles]]'', [[Patricia Wrede]] depicts wizards who use magic based on their staves and magicians who practice several kinds of magic, including wizard magic;{{Clarify|date=September 2016}} in the ''[[Patricia Wrede#Cecelia and Kate|Regency]]'' fantasies, she and [[Caroline Stevermer]] depict magicians as identical to wizards, though inferior in skill and training.\n\n[[Steve Pemberton]]'s ''The Times & Life of Lucifer Jones'' describes the distinction thus: \"The difference between a wizard and a sorcerer is comparable to that between, say, a lion and a tiger, but wizards are acutely status-conscious, and to them, it's more like the difference between a lion and a dead kitten.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[The Belgariad]]'' and ''[[The Malloreon]]'' series, several protagonists refer to their abilities powered by sheer will as \"sorcery\" and look down on the term \"magician\", which specifically refers to summoners of demonic agents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn role-playing games, the types of magic-users are more delineated and are named so that the players and game masters can know which rules apply.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|385}} [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]] introduced the term \"[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic-user]]\" in the original ''Dungeons & Dragons'' as a generic term for a practitioner of magic (in order to avoid the connotations of terms such as ''wizard'' or ''warlock''); this lasted until the second edition of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'', where it was replaced with ''mage'' (later to become ''wizard''). The exact rules vary from game to game.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizard or mage]], as a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]], is distinguished by the ability to cast certain kinds of magic but being weak in combat; subclasses are distinguished by strengths in some areas of magic and weakness in others.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=David \"Zed\"|title=Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook|date=1989|publisher=TSR|location=Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|isbn=0880387165|pages=30\u201331|edition=2nd}}</ref> [[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sorcerers]] are distinguished from wizards as having an innate gift with magic, as well as having mystical or magical ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Skip|title=Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook|date=2003|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|location=Renton, Washington|isbn=0786928867|page=51|edition=Special}}</ref> [[Warlock (Dungeons & Dragons)|Warlocks]] are distinguished from wizards as creating forbidden \"pacts\" with powerful creatures to harness their innate magical gifts.\n\n''Enchanters'' often practice a type of magic that produces no physical effects on objects or people, but rather deceives the observer or target through the use of illusions. Enchantresses in particular practice this form of magic, often to seduce.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|318}} For instance, the [[Lady of the Green Kirtle]] in [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Silver Chair]]'' enchants [[Prince Rilian|Rilian]] into forgetting his father and Narnia; when that enchantment is broken, she attempts further enchantments with a sweet-smelling smoke and a thrumming musical instrument to baffle him and his rescuers into forgetting them again.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bassham|first1=Gregory|title=The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: the Lion, the Witch, and the Worldview|date=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=0812695887|page=[https://archive.org/details/chroniclesofnarn00bass/page/171 171]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/chroniclesofnarn00bass/page/171}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sorcerer'' is more frequently used when the magician in question is evil. This may derive from its use in [[sword and sorcery]], where the hero would be the sword-wielder, leaving the sorcery for his opponent.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|885}}\n\n''Witch'' also carries evil connotations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[L. Frank Baum]] named [[Glinda]] the \"Good Witch of the South\" in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. In ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]], ''he dubbed her \"Glinda the Good,\" and from that point forward and in subsequent books, Baum referred to her as a sorceress rather than a witch to avoid the term that was more regarded as evil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Michael O.|title=Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L.

In ''[[Harry Potter]]'', a man who anomalously showed the same abilities as a witch was called a wizard. The term ''wizard'' is sometimes used as a male counterpart of ''witch'' in fiction. However, either term may be used in a unisex manner, in which case there will be members of both sexes bearing that title. If both terms are used in the same setting, this can indicate a gender-based title for practitioners of identical magic, such as in ''[[Harry Potter]]'', or it can indicate that there are people who practice different types of magic, as in ''[[Discworld]]''.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|1027}} Although technically, the gender-specific term used for a male witch is actually ''[[Warlock]]''.\n\n==Traits of magicians==\n[[File:Saluzzo-Castello della Manta-mago.jpg|thumb|White-haired and white-bearded wizard with robes and [[Pointed hats|hat]]]]\nA common motif in fiction is that the ability to use magic is innate and often rare, or gained through a large amount of study and practice.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|616}} In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], it is mostly limited to non-humans, though some people gain small amounts and become known as sorcerers (wizards being powerful spirits).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In many writers' works, it is reserved for a select group of humans,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} such as in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''Harry Potter'' books, [[Katherine Kurtz]]'s ''[[Deryni novels|Deryni]]'' novels, or [[Randall Garrett]]'s ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' universe.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|''The Alchemist'' by [[William Fettes Douglas]] (1853): studying for arcane knowledge]]\n\nMagicians normally learn spells by reading ancient tomes called [[grimoire]]s, which may have magical properties of their own.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|126}} Sorcerers in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' often gained powers from such books, which are demarcated by their strange bindings. In worlds where magic is not an innate trait, the scarcity of these strange books may be a facet of the story; in [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Tempest]]'', Prince Rupert seeks out the books of the magician [[Prospero]] to learn magic. The same occurs in the ''Dungeons and Dragons''-based novel series ''Dragonlance Chronicles'', wherein [[Raistlin Majere]] seeks out the books of the sorcerer Fistandantilus.\n\nSome magicians, even after training, continue their education by learning more spells, inventing new ones (and new magical objects), or rediscovering ancient spells, beings, or objects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} For example, [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] from the [[Marvel Universe]] continues to learn about magic even after being named Sorcerer Supreme. He often encounters creatures that haven't been seen for centuries or more. In the same universe, [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] continues to pursue magical knowledge after mastering it by combining magic with science. [[Weasley twins|Fred and George Weasley]] from ''Harry Potter'' invent new magical items and sell them as legitimate defense items.\n\n==Magical materials==\n[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Crystal Ball.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Crystal Ball (painting)|The Crystal Ball]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] (1902): using material for magical purposes; the crystal, a book, a skull, and a wand]]\nHistorically, many self-proclaimed magicians have required rare and precious materials, such as [[crystal ball]]s, rare herbs (often picked by prescribed rituals), and chemicals such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. This is less common in fantasy. Many magicians require no materials at all;<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|617}} those that do may require only simple and easily obtained materials.

In ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf refuses to surrender his own staff, breaking [[Saruman]]'s, which strips the latter of his power. This dependency on a particular magical item is common, and necessary to limit the magician's power for the story's sake \u2013 without it, the magician's powers may be weakened or absent entirely.<ref name=\"Kern\"/> In the ''Harry Potter'' universe, a wizard must expend much greater effort and concentration to use magic without a wand, and only a few can control magic without one; taking away a wizard's wand in battle essentially disarms him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm |title=Comic Relief live chat transcript, March 2001|work=Accio Quote! |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>\n\n==Use of magic==\nNevertheless, many magicians live in pseudo-medieval settings in which their magic is not put to practical use in society; they may serve as mentors, act as quest companions, or even go on a [[quest]] themselves,<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|1027}} but their magic does not build roads or buildings, provide immunizations, construct indoor plumbing, or do any of the other functions served by machinery; their worlds remain at a medieval level of technology.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brin|first1=David|title=Otherness|date=1994|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0553295284|page=[https://archive.org/details/otherness00brin/page/261 261]|url=https://archive.org/details/otherness00brin/page/261}}</ref>\n\nSometimes this is justified by having the negative effects of magic outweigh the positive possibilities.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>{{rp|8}} In Barbara Hambley's ''[[Barbara Hambley#The Windrose Chronicles|Windrose Chronicles]]'', wizards are precisely pledged not to interfere because of the terrible damage they can do. In ''Discworld'', the importance of [[Wizards (Discworld)|wizards]] is that they actively do not do magic, because when wizards have access to lots of \"thaumaturgic energy\", they develop many psychotic attributes and may eventually destroy the world. This may be a direct effect or the result of a miscast spell wreaking terrible havoc.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>{{rp|142}}\n\nIn other works, developing magic is difficult.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In [[Rick Cook]]'s ''[[Rick Cook#Wizardry series|Wizardry]]'' series, the extreme danger presented by magic and the difficulty of analyzing the magic have stymied magic and left humanity at the mercy of the dangerous [[elves]] until a wizard summons a computer programmer from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] \u2014 ours \u2014 to apply the skills he learned in our world to magic.\n\nAt other times, magic and technology do develop in tandem; this is most common in the [[Alternate history (fiction)#Alternate history in the contemporary fantasy genre|alternate history]] genre.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Patricia Wrede's ''[[Patricia Wrede#Regency fantasy|Regency]]'' fantasies include a Royal Society of Wizards and a technological level equivalent to the actual Regency; [[Randall Garrett]]'s ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' series, [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Magic, Inc.|Magic, Incorporated]]'', and [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'' all depict modern societies with magic equivalent to twentieth-century technology. In ''Harry Potter'', wizards have magical equivalents to non-magical inventions; sometimes they duplicate them, as with the [[Hogwarts Express|Hogwarts Express train]].\n\nThe powers ascribed to magicians often affect their roles in society.{{Original research inline|date=September 2015}} In practical terms, their powers may give them authority; magicians may advise kings, such as Gandalf in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and [[Belgarath]] and [[Polgara the Sorceress]] in [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[The Belgariad]]''. They may be rulers themselves, as in [[E.R. Eddison]]'s ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'', where both the heroes and the villains, although kings and lords, supplement their physical power with magical knowledge, or as in [[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'', where magicians are the governing class.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|1027}} On the other hand, magicians often live like [[hermit]]s, isolated in their towers and often in the wilderness, bringing no change to society. In some works, such as many of [[Barbara Hambly]]'s, they are despised and outcast specifically because of their knowledge and powers.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|745}}\n\nIn the magic-noir world of the ''[[Dresden Files]]'', wizards generally keep a low profile, though there is no explicit prohibition against interacting openly with non-magical humanity.

In ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', every act of magic distorts the equilibrium of the world, which in turn has far-reaching consequences that can affect the entire world and everything in it. As a result, competent wizards do not use their magic frivolously.<ref name=\"Kern\"/>\n\nIn Terry Pratchett's ''Discworld'' series, the Law of Conservation of Reality is a principle imposed by forces wanting wizards to not destroy the world, and works to limit how much power it is humanly possible to wield.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Whatever your means, the effort put into reaching the ends stays the same. For example, when the wizards of Unseen University are chasing the hapless wizard Rincewind in the forest of Skund, the wizards send out search teams to go and find him on foot. The Archchancellor beats them to it by using a powerful spell from his own office, and while he gets there first by clever use of his spell, he has used no less effort than the others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Names and terminology==\nPeople who work magic are called by several names in fantasy works, and terminology differs widely from one [[fantasy world]] to another. While derived from real-world vocabulary, the terms ''wizard'', ''witch'', ''[[warlock]]'', ''enchanter/enchantress'', ''sorcerer(ess)'', ''druid(ess)'', ''magician'', ''mage'', and ''magus'' have different meanings depending upon context and the story in question.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|619}}\n\nThe term ''archmage'', is used in fantasy works as a title for a powerful magician or a leader of magicians.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|1027}}\n\n===Reasons for distinguishing magicians===\n[[File:The Love Potion - Evelyn de Morgan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|''[[The Love Potion]]'' by [[Evelyn De Morgan]] (1903)]]\n\nIn the ''[[Enchanted Forest Chronicles]]'', [[Patricia Wrede]] depicts wizards who use magic based on their staves and magicians who practice several kinds of magic, including wizard magic;{{Clarify|date=September 2016}} in the ''[[Patricia Wrede#Cecelia and Kate|Regency]]'' fantasies, she and [[Caroline Stevermer]] depict magicians as identical to wizards, though inferior in skill and training.\n\n[[Steve Pemberton]]'s ''The Times & Life of Lucifer Jones'' describes the distinction thus: \"The difference between a wizard and a sorcerer is comparable to that between, say, a lion and a tiger, but wizards are acutely status-conscious, and to them, it's more like the difference between a lion and a dead kitten.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[The Belgariad]]'' and ''[[The Malloreon]]'' series, several protagonists refer to their abilities powered by sheer will as \"sorcery\" and look down on the term \"magician\", which specifically refers to summoners of demonic agents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn role-playing games, the types of magic-users are more delineated and are named so that the players and game masters can know which rules apply.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|385}} [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]] introduced the term \"[[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic-user]]\" in the original ''Dungeons & Dragons'' as a generic term for a practitioner of magic (in order to avoid the connotations of terms such as ''wizard'' or ''warlock''); this lasted until the second edition of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'', where it was replaced with ''mage'' (later to become ''wizard''). The exact rules vary from game to game.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|wizard or mage]], as a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]], is distinguished by the ability to cast certain kinds of magic but being weak in combat; subclasses are distinguished by strengths in some areas of magic and weakness in others.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=David \"Zed\"|title=Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook|date=1989|publisher=TSR|location=Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|isbn=0880387165|pages=30\u201331|edition=2nd}}</ref> [[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sorcerers]] are distinguished from wizards as having an innate gift with magic, as well as having mystical or magical ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Skip|title=Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook|date=2003|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|location=Renton, Washington|isbn=0786928867|page=51|edition=Special}}</ref> [[Warlock (Dungeons & Dragons)|Warlocks]] are distinguished from wizards as creating forbidden \"pacts\" with powerful creatures to harness their innate magical gifts.\n\n''Enchanters'' often practice a type of magic that produces no physical effects on objects or people, but rather deceives the observer or target through the use of illusions. Enchantresses in particular practice this form of magic, often to seduce.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|318}} For instance, the [[Lady of the Green Kirtle]] in [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Silver Chair]]'' enchants [[Prince Rilian|Rilian]] into forgetting his father and Narnia; when that enchantment is broken, she attempts further enchantments with a sweet-smelling smoke and a thrumming musical instrument to baffle him and his rescuers into forgetting them again.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bassham|first1=Gregory|title=The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: the Lion, the Witch, and the Worldview|date=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=0812695887|page=[https://archive.org/details/chroniclesofnarn00bass/page/171 171]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/chroniclesofnarn00bass/page/171}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sorcerer'' is more frequently used when the magician in question is evil. This may derive from its use in [[sword and sorcery]], where the hero would be the sword-wielder, leaving the sorcery for his opponent.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|885}}\n\n''Witch'' also carries evil connotations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[L. Frank Baum]] named [[Glinda]] the \"Good Witch of the South\" in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. In ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]], ''he dubbed her \"Glinda the Good,\" and from that point forward and in subsequent books, Baum referred to her as a sorceress rather than a witch to avoid the term that was more regarded as evil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Michael O.|title=Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L.

In ''[[Harry Potter]]'', a man who anomalously showed the same abilities as a witch was called a wizard. The term ''wizard'' is sometimes used as a male counterpart of ''witch'' in fiction. However, either term may be used in a unisex manner, in which case there will be members of both sexes bearing that title. If both terms are used in the same setting, this can indicate a gender-based title for practitioners of identical magic, such as in ''[[Harry Potter]]'', or it can indicate that there are people who practice different types of magic, as in ''[[Discworld]]''.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|1027}} Although technically, the gender-specific term used for a male witch is actually ''[[Warlock]]''.\n\n==Traits of magicians==\n[[File:Saluzzo-Castello della Manta-mago.jpg|thumb|White-haired and white-bearded wizard with robes and [[Pointed hats|hat]]]]\nA common motif in fiction is that the ability to use magic is innate and often rare, or gained through a large amount of study and practice.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|616}} In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], it is mostly limited to non-humans, though some people gain small amounts and become known as sorcerers (wizards being powerful spirits).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In many writers' works, it is reserved for a select group of humans,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} such as in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''Harry Potter'' books, [[Katherine Kurtz]]'s ''[[Deryni novels|Deryni]]'' novels, or [[Randall Garrett]]'s ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' universe.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|''The Alchemist'' by [[William Fettes Douglas]] (1853): studying for arcane knowledge]]\n\nMagicians normally learn spells by reading ancient tomes called [[grimoire]]s, which may have magical properties of their own.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|126}} Sorcerers in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' often gained powers from such books, which are demarcated by their strange bindings. In worlds where magic is not an innate trait, the scarcity of these strange books may be a facet of the story; in [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Tempest]]'', Prince Rupert seeks out the books of the magician [[Prospero]] to learn magic. The same occurs in the ''Dungeons and Dragons''-based novel series ''Dragonlance Chronicles'', wherein [[Raistlin Majere]] seeks out the books of the sorcerer Fistandantilus.\n\nSome magicians, even after training, continue their education by learning more spells, inventing new ones (and new magical objects), or rediscovering ancient spells, beings, or objects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} For example, [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] from the [[Marvel Universe]] continues to learn about magic even after being named Sorcerer Supreme. He often encounters creatures that haven't been seen for centuries or more. In the same universe, [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] continues to pursue magical knowledge after mastering it by combining magic with science. [[Weasley twins|Fred and George Weasley]] from ''Harry Potter'' invent new magical items and sell them as legitimate defense items.\n\n==Magical materials==\n[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Crystal Ball.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Crystal Ball (painting)|The Crystal Ball]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] (1902): using material for magical purposes; the crystal, a book, a skull, and a wand]]\nHistorically, many self-proclaimed magicians have required rare and precious materials, such as [[crystal ball]]s, rare herbs (often picked by prescribed rituals), and chemicals such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. This is less common in fantasy. Many magicians require no materials at all;<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|617}} those that do may require only simple and easily obtained materials.

In ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf refuses to surrender his own staff, breaking [[Saruman]]'s, which strips the latter of his power. This dependency on a particular magical item is common, and necessary to limit the magician's power for the story's sake \u2013 without it, the magician's powers may be weakened or absent entirely.<ref name=\"Kern\"/> In the ''Harry Potter'' universe, a wizard must expend much greater effort and concentration to use magic without a wand, and only a few can control magic without one; taking away a wizard's wand in battle essentially disarms him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm |title=Comic Relief live chat transcript, March 2001|work=Accio Quote! |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>\n\n==Use of magic==\nNevertheless, many magicians live in pseudo-medieval settings in which their magic is not put to practical use in society; they may serve as mentors, act as quest companions, or even go on a [[quest]] themselves,<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|1027}} but their magic does not build roads or buildings, provide immunizations, construct indoor plumbing, or do any of the other functions served by machinery; their worlds remain at a medieval level of technology.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brin|first1=David|title=Otherness|date=1994|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0553295284|page=[https://archive.org/details/otherness00brin/page/261 261]|url=https://archive.org/details/otherness00brin/page/261}}</ref>\n\nSometimes this is justified by having the negative effects of magic outweigh the positive possibilities.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>{{rp|8}} In Barbara Hambley's ''[[Barbara Hambley#The Windrose Chronicles|Windrose Chronicles]]'', wizards are precisely pledged not to interfere because of the terrible damage they can do. In ''Discworld'', the importance of [[Wizards (Discworld)|wizards]] is that they actively do not do magic, because when wizards have access to lots of \"thaumaturgic energy\", they develop many psychotic attributes and may eventually destroy the world. This may be a direct effect or the result of a miscast spell wreaking terrible havoc.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>{{rp|142}}\n\nIn other works, developing magic is difficult.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In [[Rick Cook]]'s ''[[Rick Cook#Wizardry series|Wizardry]]'' series, the extreme danger presented by magic and the difficulty of analyzing the magic have stymied magic and left humanity at the mercy of the dangerous [[elves]] until a wizard summons a computer programmer from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] \u2014 ours \u2014 to apply the skills he learned in our world to magic.\n\nAt other times, magic and technology do develop in tandem; this is most common in the [[Alternate history (fiction)#Alternate history in the contemporary fantasy genre|alternate history]] genre.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Patricia Wrede's ''[[Patricia Wrede#Regency fantasy|Regency]]'' fantasies include a Royal Society of Wizards and a technological level equivalent to the actual Regency; [[Randall Garrett]]'s ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' series, [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Magic, Inc.|Magic, Incorporated]]'', and [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'' all depict modern societies with magic equivalent to twentieth-century technology. In ''Harry Potter'', wizards have magical equivalents to non-magical inventions; sometimes they duplicate them, as with the [[Hogwarts Express|Hogwarts Express train]].\n\nThe powers ascribed to magicians often affect their roles in society.{{Original research inline|date=September 2015}} In practical terms, their powers may give them authority; magicians may advise kings, such as Gandalf in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and [[Belgarath]] and [[Polgara the Sorceress]] in [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[The Belgariad]]''. They may be rulers themselves, as in [[E.R. Eddison]]'s ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'', where both the heroes and the villains, although kings and lords, supplement their physical power with magical knowledge, or as in [[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'', where magicians are the governing class.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|1027}} On the other hand, magicians often live like [[hermit]]s, isolated in their towers and often in the wilderness, bringing no change to society. In some works, such as many of [[Barbara Hambly]]'s, they are despised and outcast specifically because of their knowledge and powers.<ref name=\"Clute\"/>{{rp|745}}\n\nIn the magic-noir world of the ''[[Dresden Files]]'', wizards generally keep a low profile, though there is no explicit prohibition against interacting openly with non-magical humanity.

His early political career was devoted largely towards maintaining the independence of Megalopolis.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Personal experiences==\nPolybius\u2019 father, Lycortas, was a prominent advocate of neutrality during the Roman war against [[Perseus of Macedonia|Perseus]] of [[Macedon]]. Lycortas attracted the suspicion of the Romans, and Polybius subsequently was one of the 1,000 [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaean]] nobles who were transported to Rome as hostages in 167 BC, and was detained there for 17 years. In Rome, by virtue of his high culture, Polybius was admitted to the most distinguished houses, in particular to that of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus]], the conqueror in the [[Third Macedonian War]], who entrusted Polybius with the education of his sons, Fabius and [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus|Scipio Aemilianus]] (who had been adopted by the eldest son of [[Scipio Africanus]]). Polybius remained on cordial terms with his former pupil Scipio Aemilianus and  was among the members of the [[Scipionic Circle]]. \n\nWhen Scipio defeated the [[Carthaginians]] in the [[Third Punic War]], Polybius remained his counsellor. The Achaean hostages were released in 150 BC, and Polybius was granted leave to return home, but the next year he went on campaign with Scipio Aemilianus to [[Africa]], and was present at the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Sack of Carthage]] in 146, which he later described. Following the destruction of Carthage, Polybius likely journeyed along the Atlantic coast of Africa, as well as Spain.\n\nAfter the destruction of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] in the same year, Polybius returned to Greece, making use of his Roman connections to lighten the conditions there. Polybius was charged with the difficult task of organizing the new form of government in the Greek cities, and in this office he gained great recognition.\n\n==At Rome==\nIn the succeeding years, Polybius resided in [[Rome]], completing his historical work while occasionally undertaking long journeys through the Mediterranean countries in the furtherance of his history, in particular with the aim of obtaining firsthand knowledge of historical sites. He apparently interviewed veterans to clarify details of the events he was recording and was similarly given access to archival material. Little is known of Polybius' later life; he most likely accompanied Scipio to Spain, acting as his military advisor during the [[Numantine War]]. \n\nHe later wrote about this war in a lost monograph. Polybius probably returned to Greece later in his life, as evidenced by the many existent inscriptions and statues of him there. The last event mentioned in his ''Histories'' seems to be the construction of the [[Via Domitia]] in southern France in 118 BC, which suggests the writings of [[Lucian#Pseudo-Lucian|Pseudo-Lucian]] may have some grounding in fact when they state, \"[Polybius] fell from his horse while riding up from the country, fell ill as a result and died at the age of eighty-two\".\n\n==''The Histories''==\n{{Main|The Histories (Polybius)}}\n\nPolybius\u2019 ''Histories'' cover the period from 264 BC to 146 BC. Its main focus is the period from 220 BC to 167 BC, describing Rome's efforts in subduing its arch-enemy, Carthage, and thereby becoming the dominant Mediterranean force. Books I through V of ''The Histories'' are the introduction for the years during his lifetime, describing the politics in leading Mediterranean states, including ancient Greece and Egypt, and culminating in their ultimate ''\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae'' or interconnectedness. In Book VI, Polybius describes the political, military, and moral institutions that allowed the Romans to succeed.  He describes the [[First Punic War|First]] and [[Second Punic War]]s. Polybius concludes the Romans are the pre-eminent power because they have customs and institutions which promote a deep desire for noble acts, a love of virtue, piety towards parents and elders, and a fear of the gods (''deisidaimonia''). \n\nHe also chronicled the conflicts between Hannibal and Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus such as the [[Battle of Ticinus]], the [[Battle of the Trebia]], the [[Siege of Saguntum]], the [[Battle of Lilybaeum]], and the [[Battle of Rhone Crossing]]. In Book XII, Polybius discusses the worth of [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]]\u2019 account of the same period of history. He asserts Timaeus' point of view is inaccurate, invalid, and biased in favor of Rome. Therefore, Polybius's ''Histories'' is also useful in analyzing the different Hellenistic versions of history and of use as a credible illustration of actual events during the Hellenistic period.\n\n===Sources===\nIn the seventh volume of his ''Histories'', Polybius defines the historian's job as the analysis of documentation, the review of relevant geographical information, and political experience. Polybius held that historians should only chronicle events whose participants the historian was able to interview, and was among the first to champion the notion of [[Journalism ethics and standards|factual integrity]] in historical writing. In Polybius' time, the profession of a historian required political experience (which aided in differentiating between fact and fiction) and familiarity with the geography surrounding one's subject matter to supply an accurate version of events. \n\nPolybius himself exemplified these principles as he was well travelled and possessed political and military experience. He did not neglect written sources that provided essential material for his histories of the period from 264 BC to 220 BC. When addressing events after 220 BC, he examined the writings of Greek and Roman historians to acquire credible sources of information, but rarely did he name those sources.\n\n==As historian==\nPolybius wrote several works, the majority of which are lost. His earliest work was a biography of the Greek statesman [[Philopoemen]]; this work was later used as a source by [[Plutarch]] when composing his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', however the original Polybian text is lost. In addition, Polybius wrote an extensive treatise entitled ''Tactics'', which may have detailed Roman and Greek [[military tactics]]. Small parts of this work may survive in his major ''Histories'', but the work itself is lost, as well. Another missing work was a historical monograph on the events of the [[Numantine War]]. The largest Polybian work was, of course, his ''Histories'', of which only the first five books survive entirely intact, along with a large portion of the sixth book and fragments of the rest. Along with [[Cato the Elder]] (234\u2013149 BC), he can be considered one of the founding fathers of Roman historiography.\n\n[[Livy]] made reference to and uses Polybius' ''Histories'' as source material in his own narrative. Polybius was among the first historians to attempt to present history as a sequence of causes and effects, based upon a careful examination and criticism of tradition. He narrated his history based upon first-hand knowledge. ''The Histories'' capture the varied elements of the story of human behavior: nationalism, [[xenophobia]], duplicitous politics, war, brutality, loyalty, valour, intelligence, reason, and resourcefulness.\n\nAside from the narrative of the historical events, Polybius also included three books of digressions. Book 34 was entirely devoted to questions of geography and included some trenchant criticisms of [[Eratosthenes]], whom he accused of passing on popular preconceptions or ''laodogmatika''.  Book 12 was a disquisition on the writing of history, citing extensive passages of lost historians, such as [[Callisthenes]] and [[Theopompus]]. Most influential was Book 6, which describes Roman political, military, and moral institutions, which he considered key to Rome's success; it presented Rome as having a mixed constitution in which monarchical, aristocratic, and popular elements existed in stable equilibrium. This enabled Rome to escape, for the time being, the cycle of eternal revolutions (''[[anacyclosis]]'').  While Polybius was not the first to advance this view, his account provides the most cogent illustration of the ideal for later political theorists.\n\nA key theme of ''The Histories'' is the good statesman as virtuous and composed. The character of the Polybian statesman is exemplified in that of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. His beliefs about Philip's character led Polybius to reject historian [[Theopompus]]' description of Philip's private, drunken debauchery. For Polybius, it was inconceivable that such an able and effective statesman could have had an immoral and unrestrained private life as described by Theopompus.<ref>Hannibal at New Carthage: Polybius 3. 15 and the Power of Irrationality\nAuthor: A. M. Eckstein, Classical Philology, Vol. 84, No. 1 (January 1989), pp. 3-4</ref>\nIn recounting the [[Roman Republic]], Polybius stated that \"the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] stands in awe of the multitude, and cannot neglect the feelings of the people\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Aid%3Db6c16 Polybius on the Senate and People (6.16)] from [[Perseus Digital Library]] at [[Tufts University]]</ref>\n\nOther important themes running through ''The Histories'' are the role of Fortune in the affairs of nations, his insistence that history should be demonstratory, or [[Apodicticity|''apodeiktike'']], providing lessons for statesmen, and that historians should be \"men of action\" ([[Pragmatics|''pragmatikoi'']]).\n\nPolybius is considered by some to be the successor of [[Thucydides]] in terms of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and critical [[reasoning]], and the forefather of scholarly, painstaking historical research in the modern scientific sense. According to this view, his work sets forth the course of history's occurrences with clearness, penetration, sound judgment, and, among the circumstances affecting the outcomes, he lays special emphasis on geographical conditions. Modern historians are especially impressed with the manner in which Polybius used his sources, particularly documentary evidence as well as his citation and quotation of sources. Furthermore, there is some admiration of Polybius's meditation on the nature of historiography in Book 12. His work belongs, therefore, amongst the greatest productions of ancient historical writing.  The writer of the ''Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'' (1937) praises him for his \"earnest devotion to truth\" and his systematic pursuit of causation.\n\nIt has long been acknowledged that Polybius's writings are prone to a certain [[hagiographic]] tone when writing of his friends, such as Scipio, and subject to a vindictive tone when detailing the exploits of his enemies, such as Callicrates, the Achaean statesman responsible for his Roman exile.<ref>Peter Green, Alexander to Actium</ref>\n\nAs a hostage in Rome, then as client to the Scipios, and after 146 BC, a collaborator with Roman rule, Polybius was probably in no position to freely express any negative opinions of Rome. [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] advises that Polybius was chronicling Roman history for a Greek audience, to justify what he believed to be the inevitability of Roman rule. Nonetheless, Green considers Polybius's ''Histories'' the best source for the era they cover. For [[Ronald J. Mellor|Ronald Mellor]], Polybius was a loyal partisan of [[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipio]], intent on vilifying his patron's opponents.<ref>The Historians of Ancient Rome, Ronald J. Mellor</ref> [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], while using Polybius as a source for Scipio's generalship, notes Polybius' underlying and overt bias in Scipio's favour.  H. Ormerod considers that Polybius cannot be regarded as an 'altogether unprejudiced witness' in relation to his ''betes noires''; the Aetolians, the Carthaginians, and the Cretans.<ref>Piracy in the Ancient World, p141 H Ormerod</ref>  Other historians perceive considerable negative bias in Polybius' account of [[Ancient Crete|Crete]];<ref>Mogens Herman Hansen 1995, ''Sources for the Ancient Greek City-State: Symposium'', August 24\u201327, 1994, Kgl. Danske, Videnskabernes Selskab, 376 pages {{ISBN|87-7304-267-6}}</ref> on the other hand, Hansen notes that the same work, along with passages from [[Strabo]] and [[Scylax]],<ref>[[Robert Pashley]], ''Travels in Crete'', 1837, J.

X.45.6&nbsp;ff.]).  This idea also lends itself to [[cryptography|cryptographic]] manipulation and [[steganography]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5\n|-\n! 1\n| A || B || C || D || E\n|-\n! 2\n| F || G || H || I/J || K\n|-\n! 3\n| L || M || N || O || P\n|-\n! 4\n| Q || R || S || T || U\n|-\n! 5\n| V || W || X || Y || Z\n|}\nThis was known as the \"[[Polybius square]]\", where the letters of the alphabet were arranged left to right, top to bottom in a 5 x 5 square, (when used with the modern [[Latin alphabet|26 letter alphabet]], the letters \"I\" and \"J\" are combined). Five numbers were then aligned on the outside top of the square, and five numbers on the left side of the square vertically.  Usually these numbers were arranged 1 through 5.  By cross-referencing the two numbers along the grid of the square, a letter could be deduced.\n\nIn ''The Histories'', he specifies how this cypher could be used in fire signals, where long-range messages could be sent by means of torches raised and lowered to signify the column and row of each letter.  This was a great leap forward from previous fire signaling, which could send prearranged codes only (such as, 'if we light the fire, it means that the enemy has arrived').\n\nOther writings of scientific interest include detailed discussions of the machines Archimedes created for the defense of Syracuse against the Romans, where he praises the 'old man' and his engineering in the highest terms, and an analysis of the usefulness of astronomy to generals (both in the ''Histories'').\n\n==Influence==\n{{Republicanism sidebar}}\n[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]\nPolybius was considered a poor stylist by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], writing of Polybius' history that \"no one has the endurance to reach [its] end\".<ref>Comp. 4</ref> Nevertheless, clearly he was widely read by Romans and Greeks alike.  He is quoted extensively by [[Strabo]] writing in the 1st century BC and [[Athenaeus]] in the 3rd century AD. \n\nHis emphasis on explaining causes of events, rather than just recounting events, influenced the historian [[Sempronius Asellio]]. Polybius is mentioned by [[Cicero]] and mined for information by [[Diodorus]], [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Arrian]].  Much of the text that survives today from the later books of ''The Histories'' was preserved in Byzantine anthologies.\n[[Image:Charles Montesquieu.jpg|thumb|upright|Montesquieu]]\n\nHis works reappeared in the West first in Renaissance [[Florence]]. Polybius gained a following in Italy, and although poor Latin translations hampered proper scholarship on his works, they contributed to the city's historical and political discourse. [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] in his ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' evinces familiarity with Polybius. Vernacular translations in French, German, Italian and English first appeared during the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book | last = Polybius |author2=Frank W.

Study of the correspondence of such men as [[Isaac Casaubon]], [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]], [[William Camden]], and [[Paolo Sarpi]] reveals a growing interest in Polybius' works and thought during the period. Despite the existence of both printed editions in the vernacular and increased scholarly interest, however, Polybius remained an \"historian's historian\", not much read by the public at large.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Burke\n | first = Peter\n | title = A Survey of the Popularity of Ancient Historians, 1450-1700\n | year = 1966\n | journal = History and Theory\n | volume = 5\n | issue = 2\n | doi = 10.2307/2504511\n | publisher = History and Theory, Vol. 5, No. 2\n | jstor=2504511\n | pages = 135\u2013152 [141]}}</ref> \n\nPrintings of his work in the [[vernacular]] remained few in number \u2014 seven in [[French language|French]], five in [[English language|English]], and five in [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Burke\n | first = Peter\n | title = A Survey of the Popularity of Ancient Historians, 1450-1700\n | year = 1966\n | journal = History and Theory\n | volume = 5\n | issue = 2\n | doi = 10.2307/2504511\n | publisher = History and Theory, Vol. 5, No. 2\n | jstor=2504511\n | pages = 135\u2013152 [139]}}</ref>\nPolybius' political analysis has influenced republican thinkers from [[Cicero]] to [[Montesquieu|Charles de Montesquieu]] to the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].<ref>Marshall Davies Lloyd, [http://mlloyd.org/mdl-indx/polybius/intro.htm ''Polybius and the Founding Fathers: the separation of powers''], Sept. 22, 1998.</ref> [[John Adams]], for example, considered him one of the most important teachers of constitutional theory. Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Polybius has in general held appeal to those interested in [[Hellenistic Greece]] and early Republican Rome, while his political and military writings have lost influence in academia. More recently, thorough work on the Greek text of Polybius, and his historical technique, has increased the academic understanding and appreciation of him as a historian.\n\nAccording to [[Edward Tufte]], he was also a major source for [[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s figurative map of [[Hannibal]]'s overland journey into [[Italy]] during the [[Second Punic War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/minard-hannibal |title=Minard's figurative map of Hannibal's war |publisher=Edwardtufte.com |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn his ''Meditations On Hunting'', Spanish philosopher [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]] calls Polybius \"one of the few great minds that the turbid human species has managed to produce\", and says the damage to the ''Histories'' is \"without question one of the gravest losses that we have suffered in our Greco-Roman heritage\".\n\nThe Italian version of his name, Polibio, was used as a male first name - for example, the composer [[Polibio Fumagalli]] - though it never became very common.\n\nThe [[University of Pennsylvania]] has an intellectual society, the Polybian Society, which is named in his honor and serves as a non-partisan forum for discussing societal issues and policy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anacyclosis]]\n* ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]''\n* [[Polybius square]]\n* [[Polybius (urban legend)]]\n* [[Mixed government]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Editions and translations===\n* Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Usher, S.

The work describes the rise of the [[Roman Republic]] to the status of dominance in the ancient Mediterranean world and includes his eyewitness account of the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Sack of Carthage]] and [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Corinth]] in 146 BC, and the Roman annexation of mainland Greece after the [[Achaean War]]. \n\nPolybius is important for his analysis of the mixed constitution or the [[separation of powers]] in government, which was influential on [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' and the framers of the [[United States Constitution]]. He was also noted for witnessing the events that he recorded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Greek Thought: Major Figures and Trends|last=Brunschwig|first=Jacques|last2=Lloyd|first2=Geoffrey Ernest Richard|last3=Lloyd|first3=Geoffrey E.

His early political career was devoted largely towards maintaining the independence of Megalopolis.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Personal experiences==\nPolybius\u2019 father, Lycortas, was a prominent advocate of neutrality during the Roman war against [[Perseus of Macedonia|Perseus]] of [[Macedon]]. Lycortas attracted the suspicion of the Romans, and Polybius subsequently was one of the 1,000 [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaean]] nobles who were transported to Rome as hostages in 167 BC, and was detained there for 17 years. In Rome, by virtue of his high culture, Polybius was admitted to the most distinguished houses, in particular to that of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus]], the conqueror in the [[Third Macedonian War]], who entrusted Polybius with the education of his sons, Fabius and [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus|Scipio Aemilianus]] (who had been adopted by the eldest son of [[Scipio Africanus]]). Polybius remained on cordial terms with his former pupil Scipio Aemilianus and  was among the members of the [[Scipionic Circle]]. \n\nWhen Scipio defeated the [[Carthaginians]] in the [[Third Punic War]], Polybius remained his counsellor. The Achaean hostages were released in 150 BC, and Polybius was granted leave to return home, but the next year he went on campaign with Scipio Aemilianus to [[Africa]], and was present at the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Sack of Carthage]] in 146, which he later described. Following the destruction of Carthage, Polybius likely journeyed along the Atlantic coast of Africa, as well as Spain.\n\nAfter the destruction of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] in the same year, Polybius returned to Greece, making use of his Roman connections to lighten the conditions there. Polybius was charged with the difficult task of organizing the new form of government in the Greek cities, and in this office he gained great recognition.\n\n==At Rome==\nIn the succeeding years, Polybius resided in [[Rome]], completing his historical work while occasionally undertaking long journeys through the Mediterranean countries in the furtherance of his history, in particular with the aim of obtaining firsthand knowledge of historical sites. He apparently interviewed veterans to clarify details of the events he was recording and was similarly given access to archival material. Little is known of Polybius' later life; he most likely accompanied Scipio to Spain, acting as his military advisor during the [[Numantine War]]. \n\nHe later wrote about this war in a lost monograph. Polybius probably returned to Greece later in his life, as evidenced by the many existent inscriptions and statues of him there. The last event mentioned in his ''Histories'' seems to be the construction of the [[Via Domitia]] in southern France in 118 BC, which suggests the writings of [[Lucian#Pseudo-Lucian|Pseudo-Lucian]] may have some grounding in fact when they state, \"[Polybius] fell from his horse while riding up from the country, fell ill as a result and died at the age of eighty-two\".\n\n==''The Histories''==\n{{Main|The Histories (Polybius)}}\n\nPolybius\u2019 ''Histories'' cover the period from 264 BC to 146 BC. Its main focus is the period from 220 BC to 167 BC, describing Rome's efforts in subduing its arch-enemy, Carthage, and thereby becoming the dominant Mediterranean force. Books I through V of ''The Histories'' are the introduction for the years during his lifetime, describing the politics in leading Mediterranean states, including ancient Greece and Egypt, and culminating in their ultimate ''\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae'' or interconnectedness. In Book VI, Polybius describes the political, military, and moral institutions that allowed the Romans to succeed.  He describes the [[First Punic War|First]] and [[Second Punic War]]s. Polybius concludes the Romans are the pre-eminent power because they have customs and institutions which promote a deep desire for noble acts, a love of virtue, piety towards parents and elders, and a fear of the gods (''deisidaimonia''). \n\nHe also chronicled the conflicts between Hannibal and Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus such as the [[Battle of Ticinus]], the [[Battle of the Trebia]], the [[Siege of Saguntum]], the [[Battle of Lilybaeum]], and the [[Battle of Rhone Crossing]]. In Book XII, Polybius discusses the worth of [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]]\u2019 account of the same period of history. He asserts Timaeus' point of view is inaccurate, invalid, and biased in favor of Rome. Therefore, Polybius's ''Histories'' is also useful in analyzing the different Hellenistic versions of history and of use as a credible illustration of actual events during the Hellenistic period.\n\n===Sources===\nIn the seventh volume of his ''Histories'', Polybius defines the historian's job as the analysis of documentation, the review of relevant geographical information, and political experience. Polybius held that historians should only chronicle events whose participants the historian was able to interview, and was among the first to champion the notion of [[Journalism ethics and standards|factual integrity]] in historical writing. In Polybius' time, the profession of a historian required political experience (which aided in differentiating between fact and fiction) and familiarity with the geography surrounding one's subject matter to supply an accurate version of events. \n\nPolybius himself exemplified these principles as he was well travelled and possessed political and military experience. He did not neglect written sources that provided essential material for his histories of the period from 264 BC to 220 BC. When addressing events after 220 BC, he examined the writings of Greek and Roman historians to acquire credible sources of information, but rarely did he name those sources.\n\n==As historian==\nPolybius wrote several works, the majority of which are lost. His earliest work was a biography of the Greek statesman [[Philopoemen]]; this work was later used as a source by [[Plutarch]] when composing his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', however the original Polybian text is lost. In addition, Polybius wrote an extensive treatise entitled ''Tactics'', which may have detailed Roman and Greek [[military tactics]]. Small parts of this work may survive in his major ''Histories'', but the work itself is lost, as well. Another missing work was a historical monograph on the events of the [[Numantine War]]. The largest Polybian work was, of course, his ''Histories'', of which only the first five books survive entirely intact, along with a large portion of the sixth book and fragments of the rest. Along with [[Cato the Elder]] (234\u2013149 BC), he can be considered one of the founding fathers of Roman historiography.\n\n[[Livy]] made reference to and uses Polybius' ''Histories'' as source material in his own narrative. Polybius was among the first historians to attempt to present history as a sequence of causes and effects, based upon a careful examination and criticism of tradition. He narrated his history based upon first-hand knowledge. ''The Histories'' capture the varied elements of the story of human behavior: nationalism, [[xenophobia]], duplicitous politics, war, brutality, loyalty, valour, intelligence, reason, and resourcefulness.\n\nAside from the narrative of the historical events, Polybius also included three books of digressions. Book 34 was entirely devoted to questions of geography and included some trenchant criticisms of [[Eratosthenes]], whom he accused of passing on popular preconceptions or ''laodogmatika''.  Book 12 was a disquisition on the writing of history, citing extensive passages of lost historians, such as [[Callisthenes]] and [[Theopompus]]. Most influential was Book 6, which describes Roman political, military, and moral institutions, which he considered key to Rome's success; it presented Rome as having a mixed constitution in which monarchical, aristocratic, and popular elements existed in stable equilibrium. This enabled Rome to escape, for the time being, the cycle of eternal revolutions (''[[anacyclosis]]'').  While Polybius was not the first to advance this view, his account provides the most cogent illustration of the ideal for later political theorists.\n\nA key theme of ''The Histories'' is the good statesman as virtuous and composed. The character of the Polybian statesman is exemplified in that of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. His beliefs about Philip's character led Polybius to reject historian [[Theopompus]]' description of Philip's private, drunken debauchery. For Polybius, it was inconceivable that such an able and effective statesman could have had an immoral and unrestrained private life as described by Theopompus.<ref>Hannibal at New Carthage: Polybius 3. 15 and the Power of Irrationality\nAuthor: A. M. Eckstein, Classical Philology, Vol. 84, No. 1 (January 1989), pp. 3-4</ref>\nIn recounting the [[Roman Republic]], Polybius stated that \"the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] stands in awe of the multitude, and cannot neglect the feelings of the people\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Aid%3Db6c16 Polybius on the Senate and People (6.16)] from [[Perseus Digital Library]] at [[Tufts University]]</ref>\n\nOther important themes running through ''The Histories'' are the role of Fortune in the affairs of nations, his insistence that history should be demonstratory, or [[Apodicticity|''apodeiktike'']], providing lessons for statesmen, and that historians should be \"men of action\" ([[Pragmatics|''pragmatikoi'']]).\n\nPolybius is considered by some to be the successor of [[Thucydides]] in terms of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and critical [[reasoning]], and the forefather of scholarly, painstaking historical research in the modern scientific sense. According to this view, his work sets forth the course of history's occurrences with clearness, penetration, sound judgment, and, among the circumstances affecting the outcomes, he lays special emphasis on geographical conditions. Modern historians are especially impressed with the manner in which Polybius used his sources, particularly documentary evidence as well as his citation and quotation of sources. Furthermore, there is some admiration of Polybius's meditation on the nature of historiography in Book 12. His work belongs, therefore, amongst the greatest productions of ancient historical writing.  The writer of the ''Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'' (1937) praises him for his \"earnest devotion to truth\" and his systematic pursuit of causation.\n\nIt has long been acknowledged that Polybius's writings are prone to a certain [[hagiographic]] tone when writing of his friends, such as Scipio, and subject to a vindictive tone when detailing the exploits of his enemies, such as Callicrates, the Achaean statesman responsible for his Roman exile.<ref>Peter Green, Alexander to Actium</ref>\n\nAs a hostage in Rome, then as client to the Scipios, and after 146 BC, a collaborator with Roman rule, Polybius was probably in no position to freely express any negative opinions of Rome. [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] advises that Polybius was chronicling Roman history for a Greek audience, to justify what he believed to be the inevitability of Roman rule. Nonetheless, Green considers Polybius's ''Histories'' the best source for the era they cover. For [[Ronald J. Mellor|Ronald Mellor]], Polybius was a loyal partisan of [[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipio]], intent on vilifying his patron's opponents.<ref>The Historians of Ancient Rome, Ronald J. Mellor</ref> [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], while using Polybius as a source for Scipio's generalship, notes Polybius' underlying and overt bias in Scipio's favour.  H. Ormerod considers that Polybius cannot be regarded as an 'altogether unprejudiced witness' in relation to his ''betes noires''; the Aetolians, the Carthaginians, and the Cretans.<ref>Piracy in the Ancient World, p141 H Ormerod</ref>  Other historians perceive considerable negative bias in Polybius' account of [[Ancient Crete|Crete]];<ref>Mogens Herman Hansen 1995, ''Sources for the Ancient Greek City-State: Symposium'', August 24\u201327, 1994, Kgl. Danske, Videnskabernes Selskab, 376 pages {{ISBN|87-7304-267-6}}</ref> on the other hand, Hansen notes that the same work, along with passages from [[Strabo]] and [[Scylax]],<ref>[[Robert Pashley]], ''Travels in Crete'', 1837, J.

X.45.6&nbsp;ff.]).  This idea also lends itself to [[cryptography|cryptographic]] manipulation and [[steganography]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5\n|-\n! 1\n| A || B || C || D || E\n|-\n! 2\n| F || G || H || I/J || K\n|-\n! 3\n| L || M || N || O || P\n|-\n! 4\n| Q || R || S || T || U\n|-\n! 5\n| V || W || X || Y || Z\n|}\nThis was known as the \"[[Polybius square]]\", where the letters of the alphabet were arranged left to right, top to bottom in a 5 x 5 square, (when used with the modern [[Latin alphabet|26 letter alphabet]], the letters \"I\" and \"J\" are combined). Five numbers were then aligned on the outside top of the square, and five numbers on the left side of the square vertically.  Usually these numbers were arranged 1 through 5.  By cross-referencing the two numbers along the grid of the square, a letter could be deduced.\n\nIn ''The Histories'', he specifies how this cypher could be used in fire signals, where long-range messages could be sent by means of torches raised and lowered to signify the column and row of each letter.  This was a great leap forward from previous fire signaling, which could send prearranged codes only (such as, 'if we light the fire, it means that the enemy has arrived').\n\nOther writings of scientific interest include detailed discussions of the machines Archimedes created for the defense of Syracuse against the Romans, where he praises the 'old man' and his engineering in the highest terms, and an analysis of the usefulness of astronomy to generals (both in the ''Histories'').\n\n==Influence==\n{{Republicanism sidebar}}\n[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]\nPolybius was considered a poor stylist by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], writing of Polybius' history that \"no one has the endurance to reach [its] end\".<ref>Comp. 4</ref> Nevertheless, clearly he was widely read by Romans and Greeks alike.  He is quoted extensively by [[Strabo]] writing in the 1st century BC and [[Athenaeus]] in the 3rd century AD. \n\nHis emphasis on explaining causes of events, rather than just recounting events, influenced the historian [[Sempronius Asellio]]. Polybius is mentioned by [[Cicero]] and mined for information by [[Diodorus]], [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Arrian]].  Much of the text that survives today from the later books of ''The Histories'' was preserved in Byzantine anthologies.\n[[Image:Charles Montesquieu.jpg|thumb|upright|Montesquieu]]\n\nHis works reappeared in the West first in Renaissance [[Florence]]. Polybius gained a following in Italy, and although poor Latin translations hampered proper scholarship on his works, they contributed to the city's historical and political discourse.

Study of the correspondence of such men as [[Isaac Casaubon]], [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]], [[William Camden]], and [[Paolo Sarpi]] reveals a growing interest in Polybius' works and thought during the period. Despite the existence of both printed editions in the vernacular and increased scholarly interest, however, Polybius remained an \"historian's historian\", not much read by the public at large.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Burke\n | first = Peter\n | title = A Survey of the Popularity of Ancient Historians, 1450-1700\n | year = 1966\n | journal = History and Theory\n | volume = 5\n | issue = 2\n | doi = 10.2307/2504511\n | publisher = History and Theory, Vol. 5, No. 2\n | jstor=2504511\n | pages = 135\u2013152 [141]}}</ref> \n\nPrintings of his work in the [[vernacular]] remained few in number \u2014 seven in [[French language|French]], five in [[English language|English]], and five in [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Burke\n | first = Peter\n | title = A Survey of the Popularity of Ancient Historians, 1450-1700\n | year = 1966\n | journal = History and Theory\n | volume = 5\n | issue = 2\n | doi = 10.2307/2504511\n | publisher = History and Theory, Vol. 5, No. 2\n | jstor=2504511\n | pages = 135\u2013152 [139]}}</ref>\nPolybius' political analysis has influenced republican thinkers from [[Cicero]] to [[Montesquieu|Charles de Montesquieu]] to the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].<ref>Marshall Davies Lloyd, [http://mlloyd.org/mdl-indx/polybius/intro.htm ''Polybius and the Founding Fathers: the separation of powers''], Sept. 22, 1998.</ref> [[John Adams]], for example, considered him one of the most important teachers of constitutional theory. Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Polybius has in general held appeal to those interested in [[Hellenistic Greece]] and early Republican Rome, while his political and military writings have lost influence in academia.

The next day, time hangs very heavy on his hands so that he even chats to a brush salesman (who has a perfect [[Elmer Fudd]] voice). Bored, he later visits his old fire station, Fire Company No.7, and talks to the men there, who are called out on a fire.\n\nThe Great Eastern Insurance Company is where Frank Rogers (who is interested in Hadley\u2019s daughter Jane) works. There have been a number of fires lately and arson is suspected. This thought is echoed at the Arson Bureau where Lieutenant King, chased up by the mayor, tells Henderson and Roberts he wants results. They know it is an arsonist who uses time bombs and gasoline. The arsonist turns out to be the keeper of an antiques shop, which Joan visits.\n\nJim is making plans for the future with Burt Stafford, who is due to retire soon. Burt is called out on a fire with the others and is very badly injured there. He dies in the hospital, with Jim standing beside him. The antiques man has called at the Hadley home to bring a salt and pepper set he had to do minor work on, which Joan had bought. She sees the gleam in his eyes when she lights a match.\n\nJim joins the arson investigation at the bureau, having had some experience when he was in the fire brigade. Spectroscopic analysis of wood found at the scene of the last big fire reveals that part of the burnt time bomb box Jim found was maple wood, so he, Henderson and Roberts scour the city for the maker of the boxes and who they sold them to.\n\nAt another big fire, Jim comes across a statue of Vulcan (the Roman god of fire) which the arsonist dropped, it being his inspiration. The arsonist gets it from Jim\u2019s unlocked car where he put it. Mention of this statue later&mdash;and the fact that Frank and Joan saw it in the antique shop window&mdash;provide a strong lead so they get a search warrant. They do not find any bomb-making equipment, but Jim finds wood shavings which later analysis reveals to be the same wood as that used for the time bomb box.\n\nJim and Frank go after the arsonist, who has lost his bureau tail. The arsonist goes to the basement of the Hadley house where he plants a time bomb. He goes upstairs and confronts Mrs. Hadley and Joan, and as Jim and Frank realize he may be back at their house&mdash;having been seen in the vicinity&mdash;the bomb goes off and the basement catches fire. The arsonist tells the women Jim should not have interfered in his work. The men bust in the door and while Frank escorts the women outside, Jim goes after the arsonist, who now babbling about being the god of fire. The arsonist falls down the basement steps into the burning basement and dies. Some time later there is another dinner in honor of Jim, who has got a new job&mdash;honorary fire chief of the city.\n\nThe film contained footage from a number of large authentic fires, a fire station, and firemen rushing to the fires and fighting the fires. No acknowledgment was given to the fire service. The unnamed city was Los Angeles as it was filmed at Fire Station 27 in Hollywood.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[J.

During the course of the day, Roberts answered questions from 16 of the 18 committee members, on a variety of topics. He affirmed his commitment to a constitutional right to privacy, clarified his position on civil rights during wartime, and took a conservative position on the use of international law in interpreting the U.S. Constitution.<ref name=\"NPR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4845368|title=Privacy, Precedents Dominate Roberts Session|date=September 13, 2005|work=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nOn September 14, the hearing resumed at 9:00&nbsp;a.m., with the completion of the first round of questioning, followed by the start of the second round of questioning.

Later, the committee went into private session to discuss FBI reports on the nominee, a standard procedure followed for all nominees to federal courts.  Following this, the committee heard testimony from the American Bar Association and six panels of various witnesses for the remainder of the afternoon and into early evening.  The hearings were adjourned with 24 hours to remain for committee members to submit written questions to Roberts, which were to be answered by him as thoroughly as practicable.\n\n===Questions and answers===\nDuring Judge [[William H.

Most Rev. [[Charles Chaput]], OFM Cap, Archbishop of Denver, noted that \"many people already believe that a new kind of religious discrimination is very welcome at the Capitol, even among elected officials who claim to be Catholic,\" concluding that \"the bias against '[[papism]]' is alive and well in America.\" However, others did not interpret the clause as prohibiting Senate inquiry into the religious beliefs of a nominee; rather they held that religious inquiries by the Senate are not the application of a religious Test (or disqualification), but a valid form of inquiry into Roberts' source of values and beliefs, which they consider to be highly relevant to a position such as Supreme Court Justice.\n\nOn September 13, during the second day of confirmation hearings Senator [[Arlen Specter]] asked Roberts whether his faith would affect his opinions on the bench. Roberts responded that \"there is nothing in my personal view based on faith or other sources that would prevent me from applying the precedents of the court faithfully in accord with the principles of [[stare decisis]].\" Later the same day, he also said \"my faith and my religious beliefs do not play a role in my judging. ... I look to the law. I do not look to the Bible or other religious books.\"<ref name=\"NPR1\"/> On September 14, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] asked Roberts about the \"role Catholicism would play\" in his tenure as a justice. Roberts declined to endorse President Kennedy's statement that \"separation of church and state is absolute,\" telling Feinstein, \"I don't know what you mean by 'absolute'.\" Some consider such questioning to be a revival of anti-Catholic bigotry reminiscent of the public concern about Catholic influence that presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] faced in 1960, and exemplified by the controversial [[Blaine Amendments]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/nextjustice/?id=110007259%7ctitle=Opinion%7cwork=opinionjournal.com|title=Opinion|work=opinionjournal.com}}</ref>\n\n===Adoption records===\nWhile investigating Roberts' life, the ''[[New York Times]]'' was accused of attempting to unseal records detailing the 2000 adoption by Roberts and his wife of two infants born in Ireland<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/press_releases/article/0,8599,1086120,00.html | work=Time | title=John Roberts | date=July 24, 2005}}</ref> via a Latin American country.

Rehnquist]], who had died two days earlier. In July 2005, Roberts had been nominated to replace retiring [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]; however, following Rehnquist's death, that still-pending nomination was withdrawn ([[Samuel Alito]] would ultimately be O'Connor's successor).\n\nThe [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] commenced hearings on Roberts's nomination on September 12, 2005. Later that month, on September 29, Roberts was confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] as the [[List of Chief Justices of the United States|17th]] Chief Justice by a 78\u201322 vote. He took the [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] [[oath of office#United States|oath of office]], administered by Associate Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] at the [[White House]], that same day. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] at the [[United States Supreme Court building]], prior to the first oral arguments of the 2005 term.\n\nAt the time of his nomination as Chief Justice, Roberts was serving as a judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. He was appointed to that position in 2003 by President George W. Bush. \n\n==White House announcement==\n[[Image:Bush shakes John Roberts hand.jpg|thumb|President [[George W.

He affirmed his commitment to a constitutional right to privacy, clarified his position on civil rights during wartime, and took a conservative position on the use of international law in interpreting the U.S. Constitution.<ref name=\"NPR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4845368|title=Privacy, Precedents Dominate Roberts Session|date=13 September 2005|work=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\nOn September 14, the hearing resumed at 9:00&nbsp;a.m., with the completion of the first round of questioning, followed by the start of the second round of questioning.  Questioning did not finish this day, and was scheduled to be continued the next day.\n\nOn September 15, the hearing again resumed at 9:00&nbsp;a.m., with the completion of the final round of questioning of Roberts.  Later, the committee went into private session to discuss FBI reports on the nominee, a standard procedure followed for all nominees to federal courts.  Following this, the committee heard testimony from the American Bar Association and six panels of various witnesses for the remainder of the afternoon and into early evening.  The hearings were adjourned with 24 hours to remain for committee members to submit written questions to Roberts, which were to be answered by him as thoroughly as practicable.\n\n===Questions and answers===\nDuring Judge [[William H.

Most Rev. [[Charles Chaput]], OFM Cap, Archbishop of Denver, noted that \"many people already believe that a new kind of religious discrimination is very welcome at the Capitol, even among elected officials who claim to be Catholic,\" concluding that \"the bias against '[[papism]]' is alive and well in America.\" However, others did not interpret the clause as prohibiting Senate inquiry into the religious beliefs of a nominee; rather they held that religious inquiries by the Senate are not the application of a religious Test (or disqualification), but a valid form of inquiry into Roberts' source of values and beliefs, which they consider to be highly relevant to a position such as Supreme Court Justice.\n\nOn September 13, during the second day of confirmation hearings Senator [[Arlen Specter]] asked Roberts whether his faith would affect his opinions on the bench. Roberts responded that \"there is nothing in my personal view based on faith or other sources that would prevent me from applying the precedents of the court faithfully in accord with the principles of [[stare decisis]].\" Later the same day, he also said \"my faith and my religious beliefs do not play a role in my judging. ... I look to the law. I do not look to the Bible or other religious books.\"<ref name=\"NPR1\"/> On September 14, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] asked Roberts about the \"role Catholicism would play\" in his tenure as a justice. Roberts declined to endorse President Kennedy's statement that \"separation of church and state is absolute,\" telling Feinstein, \"I don't know what you mean by 'absolute'.\" Some consider such questioning to be a revival of anti-Catholic bigotry reminiscent of the public concern about Catholic influence that presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] faced in 1960, and exemplified by the controversial [[Blaine Amendments]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/nextjustice/?id=110007259%7ctitle=Opinion%7cwork=opinionjournal.com|title=Opinion|work=opinionjournal.com}}</ref>\n\n===Adoption records===\nWhile investigating Roberts' life, the ''[[New York Times]]'' was accused of attempting to unseal records detailing the 2000 adoption by Roberts and his wife of two infants born in Ireland<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/press_releases/article/0,8599,1086120,00.html | work=Time | title=John Roberts | date=July 24, 2005}}</ref> via a Latin American country.

Further, Roberts has argued in a Reagan administration memo that violence such as bombings had no protection under the law: \"No matter how lofty or sincerely held the goal, those who resort to violence to achieve it are criminals,\" he wrote.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/08/AR2005080801460.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Ad Campaign Says Roberts Backed Violent Protesters | first=Dan | last=Balz | date=August 9, 2005}}</ref> NARAL was unimpressed with this memo, arguing that it was not an official action like his ''amicus'' brief.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nNARAL argued that \"This wasn't an arcane legal dispute, but a fight over whether or not law enforcement could use their most effective weapon [the Klan Act] against extremists who use violence.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/Issues/supremecourt/roberts_spin.cfm |title=Roberts Spin|accessdate=August 10, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903004320/http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/Issues/supremecourt/roberts_spin.cfm |archivedate=September 3, 2005 }}</ref> After the ''Bray'' decision, Congress passed the [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]], which criminalized obstructing access to abortion clinics at the Federal level, effectively replacing the Klan Act with an even more effective legal weapon against those that obstructed access to clinics. ''[[National Review Online]]'' argued that \"The fact that this law failed to deter the 1998 bombing that injured the clinic worker featured in NARAL's ad makes it all the more ludicrous to suggest that Roberts's proper reading of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 in 1991 is somehow responsible.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bench.nationalreview.com/archives/072303.asp |title=NARAL's Lies |accessdate=2005-08-10 |work=Bench Memos |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050904001055/http://bench.nationalreview.com/archives/072303.asp |archivedate=2005-09-04 }}</ref> In the face of intense criticism even among supporters of legal abortion, NARAL eventually withdrew the inflammatory ads.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n==Senate votes==\n===Committee===\nOn September 22 2005, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13\u20135 to send the Roberts nomination to the full Senate with a recommendation that it be confirmed.

Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel. The [[Hellenic Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Greece)|Municipal Police]], the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Greece medical cases chart}}\n\n=== February ===\n\n* On 26 February, the first case in Greece was confirmed.

It may take 2\u201314 days for symptoms to appear after initial exposure to the virus. Thirteen reporting hospitals have been designated to deal with cases. The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all carnival events in the country were initially cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel. The [[Hellenic Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Greece)|Municipal Police]], the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Greece medical cases chart}}\n\n=== February ===\n\n* On 26 February, the first case in Greece was confirmed.

Jerry Lee Lewis also released a version reaching number 1 on the country charts in 1971.

The couple [[Hitchhiking|hitch a ride]] from a truck driver and sing as they drive through the [[American South]].  They visit California and then part ways, with the song's narrator expressing sadness afterwards.

Later that year, his version of the song appeared in [[Monte Hellman]]'s [[psychedelic film|psychedelic]] [[road movie]] ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]''. Kristofferson also appears briefly singing the song in the 1971 [[Dennis Hopper]] film ''[[The Last Movie]]''.\n\nJoplin recorded the song for inclusion on her ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]'' album only a few days before her death in October 1970. Kristofferson had sung the song for her, and singer [[Bob Neuwirth]] taught it to her. Kristofferson did not know she had recorded it until after her death.

Fred Foster shares the writing credit, as Kristofferson intended.  A posthumously released version by [[Janis Joplin]] topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. singles chart]] in 1971,   making the song the second posthumously released No. 1 single in [[United States|U.S.]] chart history after \"[[(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay]]\" by [[Otis Redding]]. Jerry Lee Lewis also released a version reaching number 1 on the country charts in 1971. ''Billboard'' ranked Joplin's version as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1971|No. 11 song for 1971]].\n\nOther recordings of the song include those by [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Loretta Lynn]], Kristofferson himself,<ref name=\"Hutchinson\">{{cite web |author= Lydia Hutchinson |title= Kris Kristofferson's \"Me and Bobby McGee\" |url=http://performingsongwriter.com/kris-kristofferson-bobby-mcgee/ |date= June 22, 2013 |access-date= }}</ref> [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Olivia Newton-John]],  [[Vicki Britton]] and [[Johnny Cash]].\n\n==History==\nThe suggestion for the title came from producer and Monument Records founder Fred Foster.<ref name=\"Hutchinson\"/> \nKristofferson explained that in the song he was trying to convey the despair of the last scene of [[Frederico Fellini]]\u2019s \u2018\u2019[[La Strada]]\u2019\u2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/me-and-bobby-mcgee-story-behind-the-song/ |title='Me and Bobby McGee': The Story Behind the Song|website=Wide Open Country|date=|accessdate=September 23, 2019|first=Courtney|last=Campbell}}</ref>\n\n==Narrative==\nThe song is the story of two drifters, the narrator and Bobby McGee.  The couple [[Hitchhiking|hitch a ride]] from a truck driver and sing as they drive through the [[American south]].  They visit California and then part ways, with the song's narrator expressing sadness afterwards. Due to the singer's name never being mentioned and the name \"Bobby\" being easily identifiable to both sexes, the song has been recorded by both male and female singers with only minor changes needed to the lyrical content.\n\n==Recordings and notable performances==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Me and Bobby McGee\n| cover      = Me_and_Bobby_McGee_-_Janis_Joplin.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Janis Joplin]]\n| album      = [[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]\n| B-side     = Half Moon\n| released   = January 12, 1971<ref>https://www.45cat.com/record/445314us</ref>\n| format     =\n| recorded   = September 5 \u2013 October 1, 1970\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Blues rock]], [[country rock]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=4|s=33}}\n| label      = [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]\n| writer     = [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Fred Foster]]\n| producer   = [[Paul A.

The song was included on a [[Statler Brothers]] album but was not released as a single.\n\n[[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition]] recorded the song (with Rogers on lead vocals) and released it on their album ''[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town]]'' in 1969.\n\nKristofferson recorded his own version of the song on his debut album ''[[Kristofferson (album)|Kristofferson]]'' in 1970. Later that year, his version of the song appeared in [[Monte Hellman]]'s [[psychedelic film|psychedelic]] [[road movie]] ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]''. Kristofferson also appears briefly singing the song in the 1971 [[Dennis Hopper]] film ''[[The Last Movie]]''.\n\nJoplin recorded the song for inclusion on her ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]'' album only a few days before her death in October 1970.

It was founded around 1400 AD.<ref name=Zunipot/> It was the first pueblo to be visited and conquered by [[Conquistador|Spanish explorers]]. The pueblo site is located {{convert|12|mi|km}} southwest of [[Zuni Pueblo]], on the [[Zuni Indian Reservation]] in [[Cibola County, New Mexico]]. The site was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] as the '''Hawikuh Ruins''' in 1960, and is included as part of the [[Zuni-Cibola Complex]] of archaeological sites, a larger [[National Historic Landmark District]] designated in 1974.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hawikuh map.png|thumb|left|Map of '''Hawikuh Ruins''' by [[Victor Mindeleff]], 1891]]\n[[Estevanico]], a [[North Africa]]n slave assigned to Fray [[Marcos de Niza]]'s expedition, was the first non-native to visit Hawikuh, in 1539. ''\"Stephen reached Cibola [Hawikuh] loaded with the large quantity of turquoises they had given him, and some beautiful women whom the Indians who followed him and carried his things were taking with them and had given him. These had followed him from all the settlements he had passed, believing that under his protection they could traverse the whole world without any danger. \n\n''But as the people in this country were more intelligent than those who followed Stephen, they lodged him in a little hut they had outside their village, and the older men and the governors heard this story and took steps to find out the reason he had come to that country. For three days they made inquiries about him and held a council. The account which the negro gave them of two white men who were following him, sent by a great lord, who knew about the things in the sky, and how these were coming to instruct them in divine matters, made them think that he must be a spy or a guide from some nations who wished to come and conquer them, because it seemed to them unreasonable to say that the people were white in the country from which he came and that he was sent by them, being that he is black. Besides these other reasons, they thought it was hard of him to ask them for turquoises and women, and so they decided to kill him. They did this, but they did not kill any of those who went with him, although they kept some young fellows and let the other, about 60 persons, return freely to their own country. As these, who were badly scared, were returning in flight, they happened to come upon the friars in the desert 60 leagues from Cibola [Hawikuh], and told them the sad news, which frightened them so much that they would not even trust these folks who had been with the negro, but opened the packs they were carrying and gave away everything they had except the holy vestments for saying mass.<ref>Pedro Castaneda, Translation of The Narrative of Castaneda.

He recorded its native name at the time as '''Cevola''', though others who accompanied him wrote it as '''C\u00edbola''' in their accounts. It has been conjectured that this name comes from a word meaning \"buffalo\". Coronado was severely disappointed by the lack of gold, but wrote that, \"As far as I can tell, these Indians worship water, because it makes the corn grow and sustains their life.\" About the pueblo, he reported that,\n\n<blockquote>Although they are not decorated with turquoises, nor made of lime or good bricks, nevertheless they are very good houses, with three, four, and five stories, where there are very good apartments ... and some very good rooms underground [[Kiva]]s, paved, which are made for winter and have something like hot baths.<ref>[http://www.psi.edu/coronado/battleofhawikuh.html Coronado's letter of August 3, 1540, quoted at]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSome Hawikuu residents fled to the ''[[Dowa Yalanne]]'' mesa top to escape the attackers of the Coronado expedition. The 14 structures at ''Dowa Yalanne'' used as a refuge from the Spaniards between 1540-1680 were called ''Heshoda Ayahltona'' (\"ancient buildings above\").<ref name=\"flint\">Flint, Richard and Shirley Cushing Flint [http://newmexicohistory.org/filedetails_docs.php?fileID=21237 \"Dowa Yalanne, or Corn Mountain.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714042635/http://newmexicohistory.org/filedetails_docs.php?fileID=21237 |date=2012-07-14 }} ''New Mexico Office of the State Historian.'' 21 April 2012.</ref>\n\nIn 1628 the '''Mission La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n de Hawikuh''' was established. The Spanish attempted to suppress the Zuni religion, and introduced the [[encomienda]] forced-labor system. In 1632, the Hawikuh Zunis rebelled, burnt the church, and killed the priest. In 1672, the church was burnt again, by [[Apache]] raiders, and it was burnt a final time in 1680 during the [[Pueblo Revolt|Great Pueblo Revolt]], when all the [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] pueblos rose against the Spanish.

Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, [[emancipation]] of women, and [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun nationalism]]. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] began to encourage Afghan Islamic leaders, such as [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in [[Saur Revolution|a coup by Afghan's Communist Party]], his former partner in government, known as the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA). The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition from Islamic leaders across rural areas, but it was particularly the PDPA's crackdown that contributed to open rebellion, including [[Ismail Khan]]'s [[1979 Herat Uprising|Herat Uprising]]. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on September 11, 1979, when [[Hafizullah Amin]] ousted [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The Soviet Union, sensing PDPA weakness, [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened militarily three months later]], [[Operation Storm-333|to depose Amin]] and install [[Parcham|another PDPA faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]].\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 24609 Troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Soviet troops in 1986, during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]]]\n\nThe entry of the [[Soviet Union]] into Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its [[Cold War]] rivals, the [[United States]], Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[China]], to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated [[mujahideen]] held sway in much of the countryside. Beside Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. The [[CIA]] worked closely with Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"[[Afghan Arabs]]\", including [[Osama bin Laden]].\n\nAfter the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan]] in May 1989, the PDPA regime under [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] held on until 1992, when the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] cleared the approach to [[Kabul]]. With the political stage cleared of Afghan socialists, the remaining Islamic warlords vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country. The United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.\n\n===Warlord rule (1992\u20131996)===\n{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992\u201396)}}\n\nIn 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul.

He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe [[9/11 Commission]] in the US reported found that under the Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other [[jihadist]]s, and plot [[terrorist]] actions.{{sfn|911 Commission|2004|p=66}} While al-Qaeda maintained its own [[Afghan training camp|camps in Afghanistan]], it also supported training camps of other organizations.

After destroying the target, the Little Birds returned to the FARP and proceeded to rearm and refuel and then they launched another strike against a second site called objective Raptor. With their mission completed, the Little Birds returned to the FARP, loaded onto the MC-130s and flew back to Pakistan. Several nights later, a similar mission codenamed Operation Relentless Strike took place \u2013 this time with the Rangers driving their modified [[Humvee|HMMWV]] and Land Rovers to secure a remote desert strip.

The SAS were ordered to assault the facility in full daylight: the timelines had been mandated by CENTCOM and were based on the availability of air support assets \u2013 only one hour of on-call [[close air support]] was provided. The timings meant that the squadrons could not carry out a detailed reconnaissance of the site prior to the assault being launched. Despite these factors, the commanding officer of 22 SAS accepted the mission. The Target was a low priority for the US and probably would have been destroyed from the air if the British hadn't argued for a larger role in Afghanistan; US SOF commanders guarded targets for their own units. The strategic significance of the facility has never fully been explained.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.70-71</ref>\n\nThe mission began in November 2001, with an 8-man patrol from G Squadron's Air Troop performing the regiments first wartime [[High-altitude military parachuting|HALO]] parachute jump - onto a barren desert site in [[Registan Desert|Registan]] to test its suitability as an improvised airstrip for the landing of the main assault force in [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hecules]]. The Air Troop advance team confirmed it was suitable and later that day a fleet of C-130s began to land, each touching down just long enough for the SAS to disembark in their vehicles. Operators from A and G squadron drove directly off the ramps as the planes moved along the desert strip before the aircraft took off again; the squadrons were drove in 38 Land Rover \"pinkies\", 2 logistics vehicles and 8 Kawasaki dirt bikes, they formed up and proceeded towards their target. One Land Rover broke down due to an engine problem, the vehicle was left behind, its 3-man crew stayed to guard it (they were picked when the assault force [[Extraction (military)|exfilled]]). The assault force drove to a previously agreed forming-up point and split into two elements - the main assault force and the FSB (fire support base), A Squadron was given the task of assaulting the target facility, whilst G Squadron took the role of FSB, G Squadron would suppress the enemy with vehicle-mounted [[FN MAG|GPMG]]s, .50cal HMGs, [[MILAN]] antitank missiles along with 81mm mortars and [[Barrett M82#M82A1|M82A1]] sniper rifle, allowing A squadron closed in on the target (the force was out of range of the Coalition artillery guns).<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.71</ref>\n\nThe Assault began with a preparatory airstrike, following this, A Squadron moved from its start line, firing its weapon; they pulled up meters from the outer perimeter to dismount from their vehicles and closed in on the target on foot. All the while, G Squadron provided covering fire with heavy weapons onto the facility. Air support flew sorties until they ran out of munitions; on a final pass, a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F-18 Hornet]] strafed a bunker with its 20mm cannon, which narrowly missed several members of G Squadron.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh p.72\">Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.72</ref> As A Squadron closed on the fortified positions several SAS troopers were wounded, the al-Qaeda fighters were not particularly well trained but they were fanatical fighters and most relished the fight.

A QRF was immediately formed of whoever was in the safe house at the time: a headquarters element from 3rd Battalion, 5th SFG, a pair of USAF liaison officers, a handful of CIA SAD operators and the SBS team. The 8-man SBS team arrived in Land Rover 90s and the Green Berets and CIA operatives arrived in minivans and began engaging the prisoners, fighting a pitched battle to \"stem the tide\" of the uprising; as a result, CIA operative 'Dave' managed to escape, following this the operators turned their attention to recovering Spann's body. Over the course of 4 days the battle continued, Green Berets called in multiple airstrikes on the Taliban prisoners, during one CAS mission a JDAM was misdirected and hit the ground closed to the Coalition and Northern Alliance positions, wounding 5 Green Berets and four SBS operators to various degrees.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.72-74</ref>\n\nAC-130 gunships kept up aerial bombardments throughout the night, the following day (November 27) the siege was finally broken as Northern Alliance T-55 tanks were brought into the central courtyard to fire shells from its main guns into several block houses containing Taliban.

Nearly 3,000 tribal fighters, led by Karzai and [[Gul Agha Sherzai]], the governor of Kandahar before the Taliban seized power, pressured Taliban forces from the east and cut off northern supply lines to Kandahar. The Northern Alliance loomed in the north and northeast.\n\n[[5th Special Forces Group (United States)#Additional teams|ODA 583]] had infiltrated the Shin-Narai Valley, southeast of Kandahar to support [[Gul Agha Sherzai]], the former governor of Kandahar.

This was the coalition's first base, and enabled other operating bases to form. The first significant combat involving US ground forces occurred a day after Rhino was captured, when 15 Taliban armored vehicles approached the base and were attacked by helicopter gunships, destroying many of them. Meanwhile, airstrikes continued to pound Taliban positions inside the city, where Mullah Omar remained. Omar remained defiant although his movement controlled only four out of 30 Afghan provinces by the end of November. He called on his forces to fight to the death.\n\nOn December 5, a 2,000&nbsp;lb GPS-guided bomb landed among the Green Berets from ODA 574, killing 3 members and wounding the rest of the team. Over 20 of Karzai's militia were also killed and Karzai himself slightly wounded. A Delta Force unit nearby that had been operating nearby on a classified reconnaissance mission arrived in their [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]] and secured the site, while Delta medics worked with wounded Green Berets.

The border town of [[Spin Boldak]] surrendered on the same day, marking the end of Taliban control in Afghanistan. Afghan forces under Gul Agha seized Kandahar, while the US Marines took control of the airport and established a US base.\n\nAlso in early December 2001, as the US invasion of Afghanistan was almost completed, it was reported that warlord Dostum's forces, who were fighting the Taliban alongside the US Special Forces, had intentionally suffocated as many as 3,000 Taliban prisoners in container trucks in an incident that has become known as the [[Dasht-i-Leili massacre]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = The Death Convoy Of Afghanistan | publisher = [[Newsweek]] | date = 25 August 2002 | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2002/08/25/the-death-convoy-of-afghanistan.html | accessdate = 8 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=PHR Activities and Investigations Concerning the Mass Gravesite at Dasht-e-Leili Near Sheberghan, Afghanistan |publisher=[[Physicians for Human Rights]] |url=http://afghanistan.phrblog.org/get-the-facts/chronology/ |accessdate=7 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615043011/http://afghanistan.phrblog.org/get-the-facts/chronology/ |archivedate=15 June 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/world/nation-challenged-siege-fierce-fighting-erupts-near-kunduz-despite-surrender.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A Nation challenged: Siege; Fierce Fighting Erupts Near Kunduz, Despite Surrender Deal | first1=Dexter | last1=Filkins | first2=Carlotta | last2=Gall | date=23 November 2001 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/world/asia/08warlords.html | work=The New York Times | title=Afghan Leader Courts the Warlord Vote | date=8 August 2009 | accessdate=30 March 2010 | first=Richard A. | last=Oppel Jr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/05/world/a-nation-challenged-the-captives-prison-packed-with-taliban-raises-concern.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A Nation challenged: The captives; Prison Packed With Taliban Raises Concern | first1=Carlotta | last1=Gall | first2=Mark | last2=Landler | date=5 January 2002 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=nytimes2009-07-18>{{Cite news\n| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/world/asia/18dostum.html?scp=6&sq=Taliban%20general&st=cse | title=Afghan Warlord Denies Links to '01 Killings | date=18 July 2009 | author=Rich Oppel | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=30 July 2009| author-link=Richard A.

Signal intercepts and interrogation of captured Taliban fighters and al-Qaeda terrorists pointed towards the presence of significant numbers of foreign fighters and possible HVTs in and moving to the area; instead of committing conventional forces, higher echelons of both the White House and the Pentagon took the decision to isolate and destroy the al-Qaeda elements in the area with the US SOF supporting locally recruited AMFs (Afghan Militia Forces) - due to misplaced fear of replicating the Soviets experience in the area.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.45-46</ref>\n\nODA 572 and a CIA Jawbreaker team (small group of CIA SAD ground branch operators) were dispatched to Tora Bora to advise eastern anti-Taliban forces under the command of two warlords: Hazrat Ali and Mohammed Zaman (both had a deep-seated distrust toward each other); using CIA hard currency, some 2,500 to 3,000 AMF were recruited for the coming battle; al-Qaeda were using Tora Bora as a final strongpoint. The leader of the CIA Jawbreaker team requested a battalion of Rangers - 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment - to be dropped into the mountains to establish blocking positions along potential escape routes out of Tora Bora into Pakistan. They would serve as the 'anvil' whilst Green Berets with the AMF would be the 'Hammer,' with attached Air Force Combat Controllers, the Rangers could direct airstrikes onto enemy concentrations or engage them in ambushes; troops from the 10th Mountain Division were also an option, but this was denied.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.46-47</ref>\n\nFrom the outset of the battle, ODA 572 with its attached Combat Controller called in precision airstrikes ([[BLU-82|15,000lb Daisy Cutters]] were often used), whilst their AMFs launched what amounted to a number of poorly executed and coordinated attacks on established al-Qaeda positions with a predictable degree of success. The Green Berets discovered that the militias lacked both the motivation and skill for the battle: according to ODA members they would gain ground in the morning following US airstrikes and then relinquish control of those gains the same day, they would also retreat to their base areas for sleep each night. With the AMF offensive stalled and the CIA and ODA teams overstretched, the decision was made to deploy more troops into the battle.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.47</ref>\n\n40 operators from A squadron Delta Force were forward deployed to Tora Bora and would assume tactical command of the battle from the CIA, with the Delta squadron were a dozen of so members of M squadron SBS, members of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] also deployed to the region alongside the SBS. The Delta operators were deployed in small teams embedded within the militias and sent their own Recce operators out to pick up Bin Laden's trail, eventually with the assistance of Green Berets and CIA operators cajoling the AMF, progress was made. The Delta squadron commander agreed with the Jawbreaker assessment of the situation and requested blocking forces or the scattering of aerial landmines to deny mountain passes to the enemy and since the deployment of the Ranger battalion had been denied, he requested that his operators carryout their proposed role but all his requests were denied by General Franks. On December 12, two weeks into the battle, AMF commander Zaman opened negotiations with the trapped al-Qaeda and Taliban in Tora Bora, despite the frustrations of the Americans and British, a temporary truce was called until 0800hr the following morning to allow al-Qaeda to supposedly agree to surrender terms by Shura (group meeting). This was a ruse played to allow as many as several hundred al-Qaeda and members of the 055 Brigade to escape over night toward Pakistan.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.48-49 69-70</ref><ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.338</ref>\n\nThe following day, a handheld ICOM radio recovered from the body of a dead al-Qaeda fighter allowed members of the Delta squadron, SBS, CIA, and MI6 to hear Bin laden's voice - apparently apologizing to his followers for leading them to Tora Bora and giving his blessing for their surrender - thought to be addressed to the terrorists that stayed to fight a rearguard action to allow Bin Laden to escape. Credible rumors of cash payments by Bin Laden to at least one of the warlords abound - the reluctance of the AMF to press the attack may have been influenced by similar bribes. The leader of the CIA Jawbreaker team at Tora Bora believed that two large al-Qaeda groups escaped: the smaller group of 130 jihadis escaped east into Pakistan, while the second group including Bin Laden and 200 Saudi and Yemeni jihadis took the route across the mountains to the town of [[Parachinar]], Pakistan; the Delta squadron commander believed that Bin Laden crossed the border into Pakistan sometime around 16 December. A Delta Recce team, call-sign 'Jackal', spotted a tall man wearing a camouflage jacket with a large number of fighters entering a cave, the Recce team called in multiple airstrikes on the obvious presumption that it was Bin Laden, but later DNA analysis from the remains did not match Bin Laden's. With the majority of the terrorists gone the battle came to an end, official tallies of claiming hundreds of al-Qaeda killed at Tora Bora are difficult to confirm since many of the bodies were buried in caves or vaporized by bombs, just under 60 prisoners were taken.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.48-49</ref><ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.338</ref><ref name=\"Neville\">{{cite book |last1=Neville|first1=Leigh |title=Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan (Elite)|publisher= Osprey Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=978-1846033100}}p.20</ref> Around December 17, across the border, Pakistani Border Scouts, allegedly assisted by members of JSOC and the CIA in capturing an upward of another 300 foreign fighters. \n\nOn December 20, ODA 561 were inserted into the White Mountains to support ODA 572 in conducting SSE of the caves and to assist with recovering DNA samples from terrorist bodies.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.49</ref>\n\nUS and UK forces continued searching into January, but no sign of al-Qaeda leadership emerged.

Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, [[emancipation]] of women, and [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun nationalism]]. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] began to encourage Afghan Islamic leaders, such as [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in [[Saur Revolution|a coup by Afghan's Communist Party]], his former partner in government, known as the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA). The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition from Islamic leaders across rural areas, but it was particularly the PDPA's crackdown that contributed to open rebellion, including [[Ismail Khan]]'s [[1979 Herat Uprising|Herat Uprising]]. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on September 11, 1979, when [[Hafizullah Amin]] ousted [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The Soviet Union, sensing PDPA weakness, [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened militarily three months later]], [[Operation Storm-333|to depose Amin]] and install [[Parcham|another PDPA faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]].\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 24609 Troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Soviet troops in 1986, during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]]]\n\nThe entry of the [[Soviet Union]] into Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its [[Cold War]] rivals, the [[United States]], Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[China]], to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated [[mujahideen]] held sway in much of the countryside. Beside Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. The [[CIA]] worked closely with Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"[[Afghan Arabs]]\", including [[Osama bin Laden]].\n\nAfter the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan]] in May 1989, the PDPA regime under [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] held on until 1992, when the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] cleared the approach to [[Kabul]]. With the political stage cleared of Afghan socialists, the remaining Islamic warlords vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country. The United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.\n\n===Warlord rule (1992\u20131996)===\n{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992\u201396)}}\n\nIn 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul.

They argued that the actions taken by the terrorists in 9/11 were not attributable to Afghanistan.

AFO was a 45-man reconnaissance unit made up of Delta Force reconnaissance specialists augmented by selected SEALs from DEVGRU and supported by ISA's technical experts. AFO had been raised to support TF Sword and was tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to TF Sword. AFO conducted covert reconnaissance - sending small 2 or 3 man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]].

Over 20 of Karzai's militia were also killed and Karzai himself slightly wounded. A Delta Force unit nearby that had been operating nearby on a classified reconnaissance mission arrived in their [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]] and secured the site, while Delta medics worked with wounded Green Berets. Along with a USMC CH-53 casualty evacuation helicopter onboard ODB 570 and ODA 524 were immediately dispatched by helicopter to assist with the wounded and to eventually replace the fallen operators of ODA 574.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh p.44\"/>\n\nOn December 6, Karzai was informed that he would be the next president of Afghanistan, he also negotiated the successful surrender of both the remaining Taliban forces around Sayd-Aum-Kalay and the entire city of Kandahar itself. ODA 524, ODB 570 and Karzai's militia began their final push to clear the city.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh p.45\"/> The US government rejected [[amnesty]] for Omar or any Taliban leaders. On December 7, Sherzai's forces seized [[Kandahar airport]] and moved in the city of Kandahar.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh p.45\"/> Omar slipped out of Kandahar with a group of loyalists and moved northwest into the mountains of [[Uruzgan Province]], thus reneging on the Taliban's promise to surrender their fighters and their weapons. He was last reported seen leaving in a [[convoy]] of motorcycles.\n\nOther Taliban leaders fled to Pakistan through the remote passes of [[Paktia Province|Paktia]] and [[Paktika Province]]s. The border town of [[Spin Boldak]] surrendered on the same day, marking the end of Taliban control in Afghanistan. Afghan forces under Gul Agha seized Kandahar, while the US Marines took control of the airport and established a US base.\n\nAlso in early December 2001, as the US invasion of Afghanistan was almost completed, it was reported that warlord Dostum's forces, who were fighting the Taliban alongside the US Special Forces, had intentionally suffocated as many as 3,000 Taliban prisoners in container trucks in an incident that has become known as the [[Dasht-i-Leili massacre]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = The Death Convoy Of Afghanistan | publisher = [[Newsweek]] | date = 25 August 2002 | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2002/08/25/the-death-convoy-of-afghanistan.html | accessdate = 8 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=PHR Activities and Investigations Concerning the Mass Gravesite at Dasht-e-Leili Near Sheberghan, Afghanistan |publisher=[[Physicians for Human Rights]] |url=http://afghanistan.phrblog.org/get-the-facts/chronology/ |accessdate=7 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615043011/http://afghanistan.phrblog.org/get-the-facts/chronology/ |archivedate=15 June 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/world/nation-challenged-siege-fierce-fighting-erupts-near-kunduz-despite-surrender.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A Nation challenged: Siege; Fierce Fighting Erupts Near Kunduz, Despite Surrender Deal | first1=Dexter | last1=Filkins | first2=Carlotta | last2=Gall | date=23 November 2001 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/world/asia/08warlords.html | work=The New York Times | title=Afghan Leader Courts the Warlord Vote | date=8 August 2009 | accessdate=30 March 2010 | first=Richard A. | last=Oppel Jr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/05/world/a-nation-challenged-the-captives-prison-packed-with-taliban-raises-concern.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=A Nation challenged: The captives; Prison Packed With Taliban Raises Concern | first1=Carlotta | last1=Gall | first2=Mark | last2=Landler | date=5 January 2002 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=nytimes2009-07-18>{{Cite news\n| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/world/asia/18dostum.html?scp=6&sq=Taliban%20general&st=cse | title=Afghan Warlord Denies Links to '01 Killings | date=18 July 2009 | author=Rich Oppel | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=30 July 2009| author-link=Richard A.

Signal intercepts and interrogation of captured Taliban fighters and al-Qaeda terrorists pointed towards the presence of significant numbers of foreign fighters and possible HVTs in and moving to the area; instead of committing conventional forces, higher echelons of both the White House and the Pentagon took the decision to isolate and destroy the al-Qaeda elements in the area with the US SOF supporting locally recruited AMFs (Afghan Militia Forces) - due to misplaced fear of replicating the Soviets experience in the area.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.45-46</ref>\n\nODA 572 and a CIA Jawbreaker team (small group of CIA SAD ground branch operators) were dispatched to Tora Bora to advise eastern anti-Taliban forces under the command of two warlords: Hazrat Ali and Mohammed Zaman (both had a deep-seated distrust toward each other); using CIA hard currency, some 2,500 to 3,000 AMF were recruited for the coming battle; al-Qaeda were using Tora Bora as a final strongpoint. The leader of the CIA Jawbreaker team requested a battalion of Rangers - 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment - to be dropped into the mountains to establish blocking positions along potential escape routes out of Tora Bora into Pakistan. They would serve as the 'anvil' whilst Green Berets with the AMF would be the 'Hammer,' with attached Air Force Combat Controllers, the Rangers could direct airstrikes onto enemy concentrations or engage them in ambushes; troops from the 10th Mountain Division were also an option, but this was denied.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.46-47</ref>\n\nFrom the outset of the battle, ODA 572 with its attached Combat Controller called in precision airstrikes ([[BLU-82|15,000lb Daisy Cutters]] were often used), whilst their AMFs launched what amounted to a number of poorly executed and coordinated attacks on established al-Qaeda positions with a predictable degree of success. The Green Berets discovered that the militias lacked both the motivation and skill for the battle: according to ODA members they would gain ground in the morning following US airstrikes and then relinquish control of those gains the same day, they would also retreat to their base areas for sleep each night. With the AMF offensive stalled and the CIA and ODA teams overstretched, the decision was made to deploy more troops into the battle.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.47</ref>\n\n40 operators from A squadron Delta Force were forward deployed to Tora Bora and would assume tactical command of the battle from the CIA, with the Delta squadron were a dozen of so members of M squadron SBS, members of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] also deployed to the region alongside the SBS. The Delta operators were deployed in small teams embedded within the militias and sent their own Recce operators out to pick up Bin Laden's trail, eventually with the assistance of Green Berets and CIA operators cajoling the AMF, progress was made. The Delta squadron commander agreed with the Jawbreaker assessment of the situation and requested blocking forces or the scattering of aerial landmines to deny mountain passes to the enemy and since the deployment of the Ranger battalion had been denied, he requested that his operators carryout their proposed role but all his requests were denied by General Franks. On December 12, two weeks into the battle, AMF commander Zaman opened negotiations with the trapped al-Qaeda and Taliban in Tora Bora, despite the frustrations of the Americans and British, a temporary truce was called until 0800hr the following morning to allow al-Qaeda to supposedly agree to surrender terms by Shura (group meeting). This was a ruse played to allow as many as several hundred al-Qaeda and members of the 055 Brigade to escape over night toward Pakistan.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.48-49 69-70</ref><ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.338</ref>\n\nThe following day, a handheld ICOM radio recovered from the body of a dead al-Qaeda fighter allowed members of the Delta squadron, SBS, CIA, and MI6 to hear Bin laden's voice - apparently apologizing to his followers for leading them to Tora Bora and giving his blessing for their surrender - thought to be addressed to the terrorists that stayed to fight a rearguard action to allow Bin Laden to escape. Credible rumors of cash payments by Bin Laden to at least one of the warlords abound - the reluctance of the AMF to press the attack may have been influenced by similar bribes. The leader of the CIA Jawbreaker team at Tora Bora believed that two large al-Qaeda groups escaped: the smaller group of 130 jihadis escaped east into Pakistan, while the second group including Bin Laden and 200 Saudi and Yemeni jihadis took the route across the mountains to the town of [[Parachinar]], Pakistan; the Delta squadron commander believed that Bin Laden crossed the border into Pakistan sometime around 16 December. A Delta Recce team, call-sign 'Jackal', spotted a tall man wearing a camouflage jacket with a large number of fighters entering a cave, the Recce team called in multiple airstrikes on the obvious presumption that it was Bin Laden, but later DNA analysis from the remains did not match Bin Laden's. With the majority of the terrorists gone the battle came to an end, official tallies of claiming hundreds of al-Qaeda killed at Tora Bora are difficult to confirm since many of the bodies were buried in caves or vaporized by bombs, just under 60 prisoners were taken.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.48-49</ref><ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.338</ref><ref name=\"Neville\">{{cite book |last1=Neville|first1=Leigh |title=Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan (Elite)|publisher= Osprey Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=978-1846033100}}p.20</ref> Around December 17, across the border, Pakistani Border Scouts, allegedly assisted by members of JSOC and the CIA in capturing an upward of another 300 foreign fighters. \n\nOn December 20, ODA 561 were inserted into the White Mountains to support ODA 572 in conducting SSE of the caves and to assist with recovering DNA samples from terrorist bodies.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.49</ref>\n\nUS and UK forces continued searching into January, but no sign of al-Qaeda leadership emerged.
