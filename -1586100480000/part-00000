In 1901, two leagues were called the Western Association.  One had eight teams in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Indiana]]; it folded after only one year. The other loop, confusingly located in the same geographic area, was the former [[Interstate League]]; it reverted to its original identity in 1902.<ref name=SABR/>\n\nThe most long-lived Western Association played between 1905 and 1954.<ref name=SABR/> Originally the [[Missouri Valley League]], it existed for 42 years during that half century, suspending operations during both world wars and for one season (1933) during the [[Great Depression]].

But the bust that followed in the early 1950s, caused by the [[Korean War]], the advent of television, and a retrenchment in MLB farm systems, also buffeted the WA. It finally disbanded after the [[1954 in baseball|1954 season]], its champion Topeka club, a [[Chicago White Sox]] affiliate, drawing half the number of fans the team had drawn during the late 1940s.\n\n==References==\n*Johnson, Lloyd and Wolff, Miles, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball.''

The AmboVent respirator was engineered for mass-production at low costs, using off-the-shelf components removing the need for complex assembly lines. The device's entire [[Blueprint|blueprints]], mechanical & electrical designes, [[Source_code|source-codes]] and medical/engineering test reports were published on [[GitHub]] as [[open-source hardware]] and [[open-source software|software]] on the evening of 1 April 2020.\n\n==Background==\nThe AmboVent system was developed as a solution capable of automatically and repeatedly squeeze a [[Bag valve mask]] (BVM), sometimes known by the proprietary name \"Ambu bag\" or generically as a \"manual resuscitator\" or \"self-inflating bag\", to generate a simple but effective alternative ventilator, for use in extreme situations. The system can operate with any Ambu (or other manufacturers) BVM, sizes 1100 - 1475 cm{{sup|3}} volume.\n\nThe R&D task was initiated by the [[Israeli Air Force]] Electronics and Teleprocessing Base (Unit 108) and others such as First Israel Robotics and various experts and mentors who joined the endeavor on voluntary basis. This ad hoc team work, together as an open organization, aiming at providing in ultra-short time, a viable, usable, simple and intuitive to use mechanical ventilator. The device is being developed in open code, on a non-profit basis, to enable free and simple mass productions by anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nJoint Partners in this project include MDA Israel, Ichilov Medical Center Tel Aviv, The Israeli Airforce, MASHA 7000 and other Israeli experts and mentors coming from various disciplines to collectively advance the project on voluntary basis.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:AmboVent - Packaging.png|thumb|upright=2|AmboVent - Packaging]]\n* Manual selection of tidal volume by choosing percentage of squeeze from full volume of bag (100%) ranging from 30% to 100% of full squeeze capacity. For example, choosing 60% on the dial means the device pushes out every cycle 60% of the full volume capacity of the BVM bag.\n* Enable selection of 9 different respiratory rates from 6-24 cycles per minute, increasing by steps of 2.\n* Compatible with Ambu and other commonly used self-inflating BVM bags, ranging between 1,100 and 1,475 cc.\n* Maximum inhalation pressure setting ranging between 30 and 70 cmH{{sub|2}}O, increasing by steps of 10.\n* Predetermined I:E time ratio of 1:2. Can be changed in the program.\n* Compliance with standard [[Positive_end-expiratory_pressure|Positive End-Expiratory Pressure]] (PEEP) valves.\n* In events of resistance during inhalation (abnormal rise in air pressure) the bag squeezing process stops and regains inhalation in the following cycle.\n* Insulation of electrical and electronic parts to prevent the chance of sparking (in pure oxygen-rich ventilation environment).\n* The ventilation bellows and piping connected to it are not part of the product and need to be provided by the medical center.\n\n==Functionality==\n* Compliance with the use, connection, parts and integration of ventilation piping available in medical facilities.\n* Compact and lightweight.

The AmboVent respirator was engineered for mass-production at low costs, using off-the-shelf components removing the need for complex assembly lines. The device's entire [[Blueprint|blueprints]], mechanical & electrical designes, [[Source_code|source-codes]] and medical/engineering test reports were published on [[GitHub]] as [[open-source hardware]] and [[open-source software|software]] on the evening of 1 April 2020.\n\n==Background==\nThe AmboVent system was developed as a solution capable of automatically and repeatedly squeeze a [[Bag valve mask]] (BVM), sometimes known by the proprietary name \"Ambu bag\" or generically as a \"manual resuscitator\" or \"self-inflating bag\", to generate a simple but effective alternative ventilator, for use in extreme situations. The system can operate with any Ambu (or other manufacturers) BVM, sizes 1100 - 1475 cm{{sup|3}} volume.\n\nThe R&D task was initiated by the [[Israeli Air Force]] Electronics and Teleprocessing Base (Unit 108) and others such as First Israel Robotics and various experts and mentors who joined the endeavor on voluntary basis. This ad hoc team work, together as an open organization, aiming at providing in ultra-short time, a viable, usable, simple and intuitive to use mechanical ventilator. The device is being developed in open code, on a non-profit basis, to enable free and simple mass productions by anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nJoint Partners in this project include MDA Israel, Ichilov Medical Center Tel Aviv, The Israeli Airforce, MASHA 7000 and other Israeli experts and mentors coming from various disciplines to collectively advance the project on voluntary basis.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:AmboVent - Packaging.png|thumb|upright=2|AmboVent - Packaging]]\n* Manual selection of tidal volume by choosing percentage of squeeze from full volume of bag (100%) ranging from 30% to 100% of full squeeze capacity. For example, choosing 60% on the dial means the device pushes out every cycle 60% of the full volume capacity of the BVM bag.\n* Enable selection of 9 different respiratory rates from 6-24 cycles per minute, increasing by steps of 2.\n* Compatible with Ambu and other commonly used self-inflating BVM bags, ranging between 1,100 and 1,475 cc.\n* Maximum inhalation pressure setting ranging between 30 and 70 cmH{{sub|2}}O, increasing by steps of 10.\n* Predetermined I:E time ratio of 1:2. Can be changed in the program.\n* Compliance with standard [[Positive_end-expiratory_pressure|Positive End-Expiratory Pressure]] (PEEP) valves.\n* In events of resistance during inhalation (abnormal rise in air pressure) the bag squeezing process stops and regains inhalation in the following cycle.\n* Insulation of electrical and electronic parts to prevent the chance of sparking (in pure oxygen-rich ventilation environment).\n* The ventilation bellows and piping connected to it are not part of the product and need to be provided by the medical center.\n\n==Functionality==\n* Compliance with the use, connection, parts and integration of ventilation piping available in medical facilities.\n* Compact and lightweight. Can be positioned with flexibility around the patient's bed, up to 1.5 meters away, with no fear of increasing the dead space.\n* Standard 110-220V power line feed.\n* Two hours of continuous operation on backup batteries in case of external power supply failure.\n* Can be connected to hospital's clean air supply.\n\n==Bill of Materials==\n[[File:Arduino Nano.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Arduino Nano (DIP-30 footprint)]] \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Bill of materials|BOM List]] needed for manufacturing 1 AmboVent unit\n!

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L. Chenery]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Collier's\">''A Cavalcade of Collier's'', edited by McArdle (''Collier's'' last editor), 1959 pp. xii-xiii.</ref><ref>''Magazines in the Twentieth Century'', Peterson, 1956 p. 188; ''The New York Times'', August 20, 1974 p. 38.</ref> Martin drew many of its covers during the mid-[[Roaring Twenties]], including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923\u201327). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

''[[Collier's]]'' couldn't keep up with the rapidly changing times following [[World War II|WWII]], and ceased publication in December 1956.<ref name=\"Collier's\"/> The main culprit was television, which dramatically affected its advertising and circulation revenue.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

As an experienced soldier of fortune, he had already participated in expeditions to [[Province of Tierra Firme|Tierra Firme]], Cuba, and to Yucat\u00e1n before joining Cort\u00e9s. In his later years he was an [[encomienda|encomendero]] and governor in Guatemala where he wrote his memoirs called ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]''. He began his account of the conquest almost thirty years after the events and later revised and expanded it in response to the biography published by Cortes's chaplain [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], which he considered to be largely inaccurate in that it did not give due recognition to the efforts and sacrifices of others in the Spanish expedition.\n\n==Early life==\nBernal D\u00edaz del Castillo was born around the year 1496 in [[Medina del Campo]], a prosperous commercial city in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. His parents were Francisco D\u00edaz del Castillo and Mar\u00eda D\u00edez Rej\u00f3n. His father was a ''regidor'' (city councilor) of Medina del Campo which provided the family with some prominence. D\u00edaz had at least one older brother and they attended school together, learning to read and write. Bernal Diaz was intelligent and later showed a knack for languages, learning to speak the native dialect in Cuba, [[Nahuatl]] in Mexico, and the [[Cakchiquel language]] of the Guatemalan natives.<ref name=cerwin>Cerwin (1963)</ref>\n\nIn 1514, when D\u00edaz was about eighteen years old, he left home to join an expedition to the New World led by [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]]. It was the largest fleet yet sent to mainland America, consisting of 19 vessels and 1,500 persons. D\u00edaz served as a common foot soldier and hoped to make his fortune but when they reached [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua del Dari\u00e9n|Darien]] in present-day Colombia, they were quickly overcome by famine and an epidemic that killed more than half of the settlers.<ref name=\"Adorno\">Rolena Adorno, \"Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo\", ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerica'', David Carrasco, ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001, vol. 1, p. 323.</ref> Many of the colonists grew discouraged and looked elsewhere for new opportunities; some returned to Spain while others sailed to [[Hispaniola]] or Cuba.<ref name=\"cerwin\" />\n\n==Expedition to Yucat\u00e1n==\nIn 1516, Diaz sailed to Cuba with about 100 other soldiers looking for a share of the gold and native laborers that were said to be found on the island. They discovered that gold was scarce and the native labor was in short supply, leading D\u00edaz, in 1517, to join an expedition organized by a group of about 110 disaffected soldiers and settlers to \"discover new lands\".<ref name=\"weddle\">Weddle (1985)</ref> They chose [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (Yucat\u00e1n conquistador)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]], a wealthy Cuban landowner, to lead the expedition. It was a difficult venture and, after sailing from Cuba for 21 days, they came across the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]] coast in early March 1517, on the Cape Catoche.\n\nOn March 4, 1517, the Spanish had their first encounter with the Yucat\u00e1n natives who came to meet them on five or perhaps 10, depending on the version/translation of his work, large wooden canoes. The next day, the Spaniards disembarked, invited by the natives who wanted to show them their village. They were ambushed but managed to retreat, after killing 15 locals and having 15 wounded, 2 of whom later died. Upon leaving, the Spaniards captured 2 natives who would be translators in future expeditions. The Spanish almost died of thirst and sailed to Florida in search of potable drinking water. As they were digging a well on the beach, the Spaniards were attacked by locals. During this fracas, one Spaniard was captured by the native Floridians while the Spanish killed 22 natives. The Spanish managed to make a retreat but were also able to gather some water. They returned to Cuba, all of them severely wounded. The captain, Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, and other soldiers died shortly after making it back to Cuba.\n\nNevertheless, D\u00edaz returned to the coast of Yucat\u00e1n in April 1518, in an expedition led by [[Juan de Grijalva]], with the intent of exploring the lands. Upon returning to Cuba, he enlisted in a new expedition, this one led by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]].\n\n==Conquest of Mexico==\nIn this third effort, D\u00edaz took part in the campaigns against the Mexica, later called the [[Aztec Empire]]. By this time, he was a highly experienced member of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]'s expedition. During this campaign, D\u00edaz spoke frequently with his fellow soldiers about their experiences. These accounts, and especially D\u00edaz's own experiences, served as the basis for the recollections that Bernal D\u00edaz later told with great drama to visitors and, eventually, a book entitled ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a]]'' ({{lang-en|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain}}). In the latter, D\u00edaz describes many of the 119 battles in which he claims to have participated in, culminating in the defeat of the Aztecs in 1521. \n\nThis work also claims to describe the diverse native peoples living in the territory renamed ''New Spain'' by the Spaniards. Bernal D\u00edaz also examines the political rivalries of Spaniards, and gives accounts of the natives' human sacrifices, cannibalism and idolatry, which he claims he witnessed first-hand, as well as the artistic, cultural, political and intellectual achievements of the Aztecs, including their palaces, market places and beautifully organized botanical and zoological gardens. His account of the Mexica along with that of Cort\u00e9s are first-person accounts recording important aspects of Mesoamerican culture. ''True History'' remains one of the best accounts we have of Mexico at the time of the conquest, but its purpose and style betrays some of the biases that appear in this so-called truthful history. Bernal D\u00edaz's account has not been fully utilized as a source for conquest-era Mesoamerican culture.<ref name=\"Adorno\"/>\n\n==Governor of Antigua Guatemala==\n\nAs a reward for his service, D\u00edaz was awarded an encomienda by Cort\u00e9s in 1522. That was confirmed and supplemented by similar awards in 1527 and 1528.<ref>Carmelo Saenz de Santa Mar\u00eda, ''Historia de una historia: la cr\u00f3nica de Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo''. Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, 1984, pp. 89\u201390</ref> In 1541, he settled in Guatemala and, during the course of a trip to Spain, was appointed ''regidor'' (governor) of [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]], present-day [[Antigua Guatemala]], in 1551.\n\n==''True History''==\n[[File:Bernal Diaz del Castillo Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a 1632.jpg|thumb|Title page, Historia verdadera, 1632]]\nHis ''Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a'', finished in 1568, almost fifty years after the events it described, was begun around the same time as his appointment as regidor and was well in progress by the mid-1550s when he wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor (and king of Spain), Charles V, describing his services and seeking benefits. That was a standard action of conquerors to document their services to the crown and requests for rewards. \n\nSome version of his account circulated in central Mexico in the 1560s and 1570s, prior to its seventeenth-century publication. Bernal D\u00edaz's account is mentioned by Alonso de Zorita, a royal official who wrote an account of indigenous society, and mestizo [[Diego Mu\u00f1oz Camargo]], who wrote a full-length account of the Tlaxcalans' participation in the conquest of the Mexica.<ref name=\"Adorno\"/> Bernal D\u00edaz's manuscript was expanded in response to what he later found in the official biography of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] commissioned by Cort\u00e9s's heir, Don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, published in 1552 by [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]]. The title ''Historia verdadera'' (True History) is in part a response to the claims made by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in his published letters to the king, L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Gonzalo de Illescas and others who had not participated in the campaign. Bernal D\u00edaz also used the publication of [[Juan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda]] on [[just war]], which allowed Bernal D\u00edaz to cast the conquest of Mexico as a just conquest.<ref name=\"Adorno\"/> \n\nDespite Bernal D\u00edaz's lack of formal education and the self-interest that gave birth to his volume, the ''Historia verdadera'' evokes, like no other source, the often tragic and painful yet fascinating process through which one empire ended and another began to take shape.<ref>David A. Boruchoff, \"Beyond Utopia and Paradise: Cort\u00e9s, Bernal D\u00edaz and the Rhetoric of Consecration.\" ''M L N'' [''Modern Language Notes''] 1991, 106, 2. pp. 330-369</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBernal D\u00edaz died on January 11, 1584. He was alive on 1 January, but on 3 January, his son, Francisco, appeared before the Cabildo of Guatemala and informed them that his father had died.<ref>Henry R. Wagner, \"Notes on Writings by and about Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo\", ''The Hispanic American Historical Review'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (May, 1945), pp. 199-211, at p. 207.</ref> [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]] accepts this date in his Introduction (dated July 1984 \"''a cuatro siglos de la muerte de Bernal''\") to the anthology of extended excerpts from the ''Historia verdadera''.<ref>published in 1988 by Conaculta (''Consejo nacional para la cultura y las artes'') in its series \"100 de M\u00e9xico\", p. 31.</ref> Alicia Mayer (2005) praised that edition, its selection, and Le\u00f3n-Portilla's introduction, saying they remained, down to the date of her review, \"''fuente imprescindible de consulta''\" (an indispensable source to consult) without seeing his manuscript published. An expanded and corrected copy of the manuscript kept in Guatemala was sent to Spain and published, with revisions, in 1632. The manuscript was edited by Fray Alonso de Rem\u00f3n and Fray Gabriel Adarzo y Santander prior to publication. In this first published edition of Bernal D\u00edaz's work, there is a chapter (212), which some consider apocryphal with signs and portents of the conquest and omitted for later editions.<ref name=\"Adorno\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Boruchoff |first1=David A. |title=Beyond Utopia and Paradise: Cort\u00e9s, Bernal D\u00edaz and the Rhetoric of Consecration |journal=Modern Language Notes |date=1991 |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=330-369}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cerwin |first1=Herbert |title=Bernal Diaz: Historian of the Conquest |date=1963 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Montoya|first=Claudia|editor-last= Kaplan|editor-first=Gregory B.|encyclopedia=Sixteenth-Century Spanish Writers |title=Bernal Diaz del Castillo |date=2005 |year= |publisher=Gale |series=Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 318 |volume= }}\n*{{cite book |author=Prescott, William H. |authorlink=William H.

It was the largest fleet yet sent to mainland America, consisting of 19 vessels and 1,500 persons. D\u00edaz served as a common foot soldier and hoped to make his fortune but when they reached [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua del Dari\u00e9n|Darien]] in present-day Colombia, they were quickly overcome by famine and an epidemic that killed more than half of the settlers.<ref name=\"Adorno\">Rolena Adorno, \"Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo\", ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerica'', David Carrasco, ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001, vol. 1, p. 323.</ref> Many of the colonists grew discouraged and looked elsewhere for new opportunities; some returned to Spain while others sailed to [[Hispaniola]] or Cuba.<ref name=\"cerwin\" />\n\n==Expedition to Yucat\u00e1n==\nIn 1516, Diaz sailed to Cuba with about 100 other soldiers looking for a share of the gold and native laborers that were said to be found on the island. They discovered that gold was scarce and the native labor was in short supply, leading D\u00edaz, in 1517, to join an expedition organized by a group of about 110 disaffected soldiers and settlers to \"discover new lands\".<ref name=\"weddle\">Weddle (1985)</ref> They chose [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (Yucat\u00e1n conquistador)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]], a wealthy Cuban landowner, to lead the expedition. It was a difficult venture and, after sailing from Cuba for 21 days, they came across the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]] coast in early March 1517, on the Cape Catoche.\n\nOn March 4, 1517, the Spanish had their first encounter with the Yucat\u00e1n natives who came to meet them on five or perhaps 10, depending on the version/translation of his work, large wooden canoes. The next day, the Spaniards disembarked, invited by the natives who wanted to show them their village. They were ambushed but managed to retreat, after killing 15 locals and having 15 wounded, 2 of whom later died. Upon leaving, the Spaniards captured 2 natives who would be translators in future expeditions. The Spanish almost died of thirst and sailed to Florida in search of potable drinking water. As they were digging a well on the beach, the Spaniards were attacked by locals. During this fracas, one Spaniard was captured by the native Floridians while the Spanish killed 22 natives. The Spanish managed to make a retreat but were also able to gather some water. They returned to Cuba, all of them severely wounded. The captain, Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, and other soldiers died shortly after making it back to Cuba.\n\nNevertheless, D\u00edaz returned to the coast of Yucat\u00e1n in April 1518, in an expedition led by [[Juan de Grijalva]], with the intent of exploring the lands. Upon returning to Cuba, he enlisted in a new expedition, this one led by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]].\n\n==Conquest of Mexico==\nIn this third effort, D\u00edaz took part in the campaigns against the Mexica, later called the [[Aztec Empire]]. By this time, he was a highly experienced member of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]'s expedition. During this campaign, D\u00edaz spoke frequently with his fellow soldiers about their experiences. These accounts, and especially D\u00edaz's own experiences, served as the basis for the recollections that Bernal D\u00edaz later told with great drama to visitors and, eventually, a book entitled ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a]]'' ({{lang-en|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain}}). In the latter, D\u00edaz describes many of the 119 battles in which he claims to have participated in, culminating in the defeat of the Aztecs in 1521. \n\nThis work also claims to describe the diverse native peoples living in the territory renamed ''New Spain'' by the Spaniards. Bernal D\u00edaz also examines the political rivalries of Spaniards, and gives accounts of the natives' human sacrifices, cannibalism and idolatry, which he claims he witnessed first-hand, as well as the artistic, cultural, political and intellectual achievements of the Aztecs, including their palaces, market places and beautifully organized botanical and zoological gardens. His account of the Mexica along with that of Cort\u00e9s are first-person accounts recording important aspects of Mesoamerican culture. ''True History'' remains one of the best accounts we have of Mexico at the time of the conquest, but its purpose and style betrays some of the biases that appear in this so-called truthful history. Bernal D\u00edaz's account has not been fully utilized as a source for conquest-era Mesoamerican culture.<ref name=\"Adorno\"/>\n\n==Governor of Antigua Guatemala==\n\nAs a reward for his service, D\u00edaz was awarded an encomienda by Cort\u00e9s in 1522. That was confirmed and supplemented by similar awards in 1527 and 1528.<ref>Carmelo Saenz de Santa Mar\u00eda, ''Historia de una historia: la cr\u00f3nica de Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo''. Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, 1984, pp. 89\u201390</ref> In 1541, he settled in Guatemala and, during the course of a trip to Spain, was appointed ''regidor'' (governor) of [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]], present-day [[Antigua Guatemala]], in 1551.\n\n==''True History''==\n[[File:Bernal Diaz del Castillo Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a 1632.jpg|thumb|Title page, Historia verdadera, 1632]]\nHis ''Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a'', finished in 1568, almost fifty years after the events it described, was begun around the same time as his appointment as regidor and was well in progress by the mid-1550s when he wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor (and king of Spain), Charles V, describing his services and seeking benefits. That was a standard action of conquerors to document their services to the crown and requests for rewards. \n\nSome version of his account circulated in central Mexico in the 1560s and 1570s, prior to its seventeenth-century publication. Bernal D\u00edaz's account is mentioned by Alonso de Zorita, a royal official who wrote an account of indigenous society, and mestizo [[Diego Mu\u00f1oz Camargo]], who wrote a full-length account of the Tlaxcalans' participation in the conquest of the Mexica.<ref name=\"Adorno\"/> Bernal D\u00edaz's manuscript was expanded in response to what he later found in the official biography of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] commissioned by Cort\u00e9s's heir, Don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, published in 1552 by [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]]. The title ''Historia verdadera'' (True History) is in part a response to the claims made by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in his published letters to the king, L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Gonzalo de Illescas and others who had not participated in the campaign. Bernal D\u00edaz also used the publication of [[Juan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda]] on [[just war]], which allowed Bernal D\u00edaz to cast the conquest of Mexico as a just conquest.<ref name=\"Adorno\"/> \n\nDespite Bernal D\u00edaz's lack of formal education and the self-interest that gave birth to his volume, the ''Historia verdadera'' evokes, like no other source, the often tragic and painful yet fascinating process through which one empire ended and another began to take shape.<ref>David A. Boruchoff, \"Beyond Utopia and Paradise: Cort\u00e9s, Bernal D\u00edaz and the Rhetoric of Consecration.\" ''M L N'' [''Modern Language Notes''] 1991, 106, 2. pp. 330-369</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBernal D\u00edaz died on January 11, 1584.

An expanded and corrected copy of the manuscript kept in Guatemala was sent to Spain and published, with revisions, in 1632. The manuscript was edited by Fray Alonso de Rem\u00f3n and Fray Gabriel Adarzo y Santander prior to publication. In this first published edition of Bernal D\u00edaz's work, there is a chapter (212), which some consider apocryphal with signs and portents of the conquest and omitted for later editions.<ref name=\"Adorno\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Boruchoff |first1=David A. |title=Beyond Utopia and Paradise: Cort\u00e9s, Bernal D\u00edaz and the Rhetoric of Consecration |journal=Modern Language Notes |date=1991 |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=330-369}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cerwin |first1=Herbert |title=Bernal Diaz: Historian of the Conquest |date=1963 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Montoya|first=Claudia|editor-last= Kaplan|editor-first=Gregory B.|encyclopedia=Sixteenth-Century Spanish Writers |title=Bernal Diaz del Castillo |date=2005 |year= |publisher=Gale |series=Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 318 |volume= }}\n*{{cite book |author=Prescott, William H. |authorlink=William H.

He was the director of the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]] in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]. The sanitarium was founded by members of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. It combined aspects of a European spa, a hydrotherapy institution, a hospital and a high-class hotel. Kellogg treated both the rich and famous, as well as the poor who could not afford other hospitals.\n\nDisagreements with other members of the church led to a major schism within the denomination: Kellogg was disfellowshipped in 1907, but continued to follow many Adventist beliefs and directed the sanitarium until his death in 1943. Kellogg also helped to establish the [[American Medical Missionary College]] in 1895. The College operated independently until 1910, when it merged with [[Illinois State University]].\n\nKellogg was a major leader in progressive health reform, particularly in the second phase of the [[clean living movement]].<ref name=\"Engs\">{{cite book|last1=Engs|first1=Ruth Clifford|title=The progressive era's health reform movement|date=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0275979324|pages=192\u2013195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNeGQRBgd_MC&pg=PA192|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Heather Arndt|title=Breakfast a history|date=2013|publisher=AltaMira Press, a division of Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham|isbn=9780759121652|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LghYCqDJw8C&pg=PA21}}</ref> \nHe wrote extensively on science and health.

There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played. According to some accounts, Ella suggested rolling out the dough into thin sheets, and John developed a set of rollers for the purpose. According to others, John had the idea in a dream, and used equipment in his wife's kitchen to do the rolling. It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the next morning, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked. Will Kellogg was tasked with figuring out what had happened, and recreating the process reliably. Ella and Will were often at odds, and their versions of the story tend to minimize or deny each other's involvement, while emphasizing their own part in the discovery.<ref name=\"Markel\"/> The process that Kellogg had discovered, tempering, was to be a fundamental technique of the flaked cereal industry.<ref name=\"Schwarz\"/>{{rp|116}}\n\nA patent for \"Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same\" was filed on May 31, 1895, and issued on April 14, 1896 to John Harvey Kellogg as Patent No. 558,393.

His view was that caffeine was a poison.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new dietetics : a guide to scientific feeding in health and disease|last=Kellogg|first=John Harvey|publisher=Kessinger Pub.

He blamed the prevalence of these beverages not only on the prohibition of alcoholic beverages at the time, but also on the extensive marketing efforts organized by the producers of these products. Kellogg's view was that \"nature has supplied us with pure water, with a great variety of fruit juices and wholesome and harmless flavors quite sufficient to meet all our needs.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new dietetics : a guide to scientific feeding in health and disease|last=Kellogg|first=John Harvey|publisher=Kessinger Pub.

For the 15 years that the organization persisted, Kellogg remained as its president.<ref name=\"Schwarz\"/>{{rp|107}}\n\n==Hydropathy==\n===Properties of water===\nKellogg has labeled the various uses of hydropathy as being byproducts of the many properties of water. In his 1867 book, ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease'', he acknowledges both the chemical composition and physical properties of water. Hydrogen and oxygen, when separate, are two \"colorless, transparent, and tasteless\" gases, which are explosive when mixed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Uses of Water in Health & Disease|last=Kellogg|first=John Harvey|publisher=Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer|year=1876|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}</ref> More importantly, water, he says, has the highest specific heat of any compound (although in actuality it does not). As such, the amount of heat and energy needed to elevate the temperature of water is significantly higher than that of other compounds like mercury. Kellogg addressed water's ability to absorb massive amounts of energies when shifting phases. He also highlighted water's most useful property, its ability to dissolve many other substances.<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Remedial properties of water===\nAccording to Kellogg, water provides remedial properties partly because of vital resistance and partly because of its physical properties. For Kellogg, the medical uses of water begin with its function as a refrigerant, a way to lower body heat by way of dissipating its production as well as by conduction. \"There is not a drug in the whole materia medica that will diminish the temperature of the body so readily and so efficiently as water.\"<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Water can also serve as a sedative. While other substances serve as sedatives by exerting their poisonous influences on the heart and nerves, water is a gentler and more efficient sedative without any of the negative side-effects seen in these other substances. Kellogg states that a cold bath can often reduce one's pulse by 20 to 40 beats per minute quickly, in a matter of a few minutes. Additionally, water can function as a tonic, increasing both the speed of circulation and the overall temperature of the body. A hot bath accelerates one's pulse from 70 to 150 beats per minute in 15 minutes. Water is also useful as an anodyne since it can lower nervous sensibility and reduce pain when applied in the form of hot fomentation. Kellogg argues that this procedure will often give one relief where every other drug has failed to do so. He also believed that no other treatment could function as well as an antispasmodic, reducing infantile convulsions and cramps, as water. Water can be an effective astringent as, when applied cold, it can arrest hemorrhages. Moreover, it can be very effective in producing bowel movements. Whereas purgatives would introduce \"violent and unpleasant symptoms\", water would not. Although it would not have much competition as an emetic at the time, Kellogg believed that no other substance could induce vomiting as well as water did. Returning to one of Kellogg's most admired qualities of water, it can function as a \"most perfect eliminative\". Water can dissolve waste and foreign matter from the blood. These many uses of water led Kellogg to belief that \"the aim of the faithful physician should be to accomplish for his patient the greatest amount of good at the least expence {{sic|hide=y}} of vitality; and it is an indisputable fact that in a large number of cases water is just the agent with which this desirable end can be obtained.\"<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Incorrect uses of the water cure===\nAlthough Kellogg praised hydropathy for its many uses, he did acknowledge its limits. \"In nearly all cases, sunlight, pure air, rest, exercise, proper food, and other hygienic agencies are quite as important as water. Electricity, too, is a remedy which should not be ignored; and skillful surgery is absolutely indispensable in not a small number of cases.\"<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 78.</ref> With this belief, he went on to criticize many medical figures who misused or overestimated hydropathy in the treating of disease. Among these, he criticized what he referred to as \"Cold-Water Doctors\" who would recommend the same remedy regardless of the type of ailment or temperament of the patient.<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 71.</ref> These doctors would prescribe ice-cold baths in unwarmed rooms even during the harshest winters. In his opinion, this prejudicial approach to illness resulted in converting hydropathy to a more heroic type of treatment where many became obsessed with taking baths in ice-cold water. He addresses the negative consequences that resulted from this \"infatuation\", among them tuberculosis and other diseases.<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 72.</ref> This dangerous habit was only exacerbated by physicians who used hydropathy in excess. Kellogg recounts an instance where a patient with a low typhus fever was treated with 35 cold packs while in a feeble state and, not to the surprise of Kellogg, died. Kellogg posits this excessive and dangerous use of hydropathy as a return to the \"violent processes\" of bloodletting, antimony, mercury and purgatives.<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 74.</ref> Kellogg also criticizes the ignorance in \"Hydropathic Quacks\" as well as in Preissnitz, the founder of modern hydropathy, himself. Kellogg states that the \"Quacks\" as well as Preissnitz are ignorant for overestimating the hydropathy as a \"cure-all\" remedy without understanding the true nature of disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Uses of Water in Health & Disease|last=Kellogg|first=John Harvey|publisher=Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer|year=1876|isbn=|location=|pages=76}}</ref>\n\n==Views on sexuality==\nBoth as a doctor and an Adventist, Kellogg was an advocate of sexual abstinence.

By 1886 it was 644 pages; by 1901, 720 pages; by 1903, 798; and in 1917 Kellogg published a four-volume edition of 900 pages.

This was an orthodox view at the time, especially during the earlier part of his lifetime. Kellogg was able to draw upon many medical sources' claims such as \"neither the plague, nor war, nor small-pox, nor similar diseases, have produced results so disastrous to humanity as the pernicious habit of [[onanism]]\", credited to one Dr. [[Adam Clarke]]. Kellogg strongly warned against the habit in his own words, claiming of masturbation-related deaths \"such a victim literally dies by his own hand\", among other condemnations. He felt that masturbation destroyed not only physical and mental health, but moral health as well. Kellogg also believed the practice of this \"solitary-vice\" caused cancer of the womb, urinary diseases, nocturnal emissions, impotence, epilepsy, insanity, and mental and physical debility; \"dimness of vision\" was only briefly mentioned. Kellogg thought that masturbation was the worst evil one could commit; he often referred to it as \"self-abuse\".<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Money\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John Money\n | title = The Destroying Angel: Sex, Fitness, & Food in the Legacy of Degeneracy Theory, Graham Crackers, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, & American Health History\n | publisher = Prometheus Books\n | date = 1985\n | location = New York\n | pages = 85}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Kimmel\n | first = Michael\n | authorlink = Michael Kimmel\n | title = Manhood in America, a cultural history\n | url = https://archive.org/details/manhoodinamerica00kimm\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher = The Free Press\n | date = 1996\n | location = New York }}</ref>\nKellogg considered sexual climax to be a serious exhaustion of nervous energy writing \"..[sex] is accompanied by a peculiar nervous spasm, ...one more exhausting to the system than any other...\"<ref>{{cite book\n | authorlink = John Harvey Kellogg\n | title = Plain Facts for Old and Young\n | pages = 64}}</ref>\n\n===Masturbation prevention===\nAs a leader of the anti-masturbation movement, Kellogg promoted extreme measures to prevent masturbation. He circumcised himself at age 37. His methods for the \"rehabilitation\" of masturbators included measures up to the point of mutilation without anesthetic, on both sexes. He was an advocate of circumcising young boys to curb masturbation and applying [[Phenol|carbolic acid]] to a young woman's [[clitoris]]. In his ''Plain Facts for Old and Young'',<ref name=plainfacts /> he wrote:\n\n{{quote|A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of [[phimosis]]. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases. The soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and not resumed.<ref name=\"p. 325\" />}}\n\nfurther\n\n{{quote|a method of treatment [to prevent masturbation] ... and we have employed it with entire satisfaction. It consists in the application of one or more silver sutures in such a way as to prevent erection.

After drawing the wire through, the ends are twisted together, and cut off close.

Whether he continued to teach the \"facts\" in it is not entirely clear, although it appears from the later books he wrote that he moved away from this subject matter.

He was the director of the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]] in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]. The sanitarium was founded by members of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. It combined aspects of a European spa, a hydrotherapy institution, a hospital and a high-class hotel. Kellogg treated both the rich and famous and the poor who could not afford other hospitals.\n\nDisagreements with other members of the church led to a major schism within the denomination: Kellogg was disfellowshipped in 1907, but continued to follow many Adventist beliefs and directed the sanitarium until his death in 1943. Kellogg also helped to establish the [[American Medical Missionary College]] in 1895. The College operated independently until 1910, when it merged with [[Illinois State University]].\n\nKellogg was a major leader in progressive health reform, particularly in the second phase of the [[clean living movement]].<ref name=\"Engs\">{{cite book|last1=Engs|first1=Ruth Clifford|title=The progressive era's health reform movement|date=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0275979324|pages=192\u2013195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNeGQRBgd_MC&pg=PA192|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Heather Arndt|title=Breakfast a history|date=2013|publisher=AltaMira Press, a division of Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham|isbn=9780759121652|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LghYCqDJw8C&pg=PA21}}</ref> \nHe wrote extensively on science and health.

Kellogg began experimenting to produce a softer breakfast food, something easy to chew. He developed a dough that was a mixture of wheat, [[oats]], and corn. It was baked at high temperatures for a long period of time, to break down or \"dextrinize\" starch molecules in the grain. After it cooled, Kellogg broke the bread into crumbs. The cereal was originally marketed under the name \"[[Granula]]\" but this led to legal problems with [[James Caleb Jackson]] who already sold a wheat cereal under that name. In 1881, under threat of a lawsuit by Jackson, Kellogg changed the sanitarium cereal's name to \"Granola\".<ref name=\"Markel\">{{cite book| first=Howard |last=Markel |title=The Kelloggs: The Battling Brothers of Battle Creek |year=2017 |isbn=978-0307907271 |publisher=Pantheon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3siXDQAAQBAJ}}</ref> \nIt was used initially by patients at the sanitarium, but slowly began to build up a following among former patients.<ref name=\"Schwarz\"/>{{rp|115}} In 1890, John formed the Sanitas Food Company to develop and market food products.<ref name=\"Engs\"/>{{rp|53}}\n\nThe Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal [[corn flakes]]. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played. According to some accounts, Ella suggested rolling out the dough into thin sheets, and John developed a set of rollers for the purpose. According to others, John had the idea in a dream, and used equipment in his wife's kitchen to do the rolling. It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the next morning, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked. Will Kellogg was tasked with figuring out what had happened, and recreating the process reliably. Ella and Will were often at odds, and their versions of the story tend to minimize or deny each other's involvement, while emphasizing their own part in the discovery.<ref name=\"Markel\"/> The process that Kellogg had discovered, tempering, was to be a fundamental technique of the flaked cereal industry.<ref name=\"Schwarz\"/>{{rp|116}}\n\nA patent for \"Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same\" was filed on May 31, 1895, and issued on April 14, 1896 to John Harvey Kellogg as Patent No. 558,393. Significantly, the patent applied to a variety of types of grains, not just to wheat. John Harvey Kellogg was the only person named on the patent.<ref name=\"Flaked\">John Harvey Kellogg, U.S. Patent no. {{US patent|558393|558,393}}, ''Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same'', filed May 31, 1895, issued April 14, 1896.</ref> Will later insisted that he, not Ella, had worked with John, and repeatedly asserted that he should have received more credit than he was given for the discovery of the flaked cereal.<ref name=\"Markel\"/>\n\nDuring their first year of production, the Kelloggs sold tens of thousands of pounds of flaked cereal, marketing it as \"Granose\". They continued to experiment using rice and corn as well as wheat, and in 1898 released the first batch of Sanitas Toasted Corn Flakes. A modified version with a longer shelf life was released in 1902.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/> By that time, both \"Granose Biscuits\" and \"Granose Flakes\" were available.<ref name=\"Merrill\">{{cite book|last1=Merrill|first1=L.

Co. | year = 1881}}</ref>\n\nAs he specialized in certain gynecological surgeries (particularly [[Hemorrhoidectomy|hemorrhoidectomies]] and [[Ovariotomy|ovariotomies]]) and [[gastrointestinal]] surgeries, he developed various instruments for these operations. These included specialized hooks and [[Retractor (medical)|retractors]], a heated operating table, and an aseptic drainage tube used in abdominal surgery.<ref name=\"Schwarz\"/>{{rp|116\u2013127}}\n\nAdditionally, Kellogg took keen interest in devising instruments for [[light therapy]], mechanical exercising, proper breathing, and [[hydrotherapy]]. His medical inventions spanned a wide range of applications and included a hot air bath, vibrating chair, oscillomanipulator, window tent for fresh air, [[pneumograph]] to graphically represent respiratory habits,<ref name=\"Schwarz\" /> [[loofah]] mitt, and an apparatus for home sterilization of milk.<ref name=\"Schwarz\" /> Some of his inventions were fashionable enough to be included in the first class gymnasium of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.<ref name=\"Rejuvenators\">{{cite web |title=The Kellogg Rejuvenators |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/23683 |accessdate=March 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKellogg did not make concerted efforts to profit from his medical inventions.

He blamed the prevalence of these beverages not only on the prohibition of alcoholic beverages at the time, but also on the extensive marketing efforts organized by the producers of these products.

White, the founder of the Seventh-day Adventists, and several others, had organized the American Health and Temperance Association.<ref name=\"Schwarz\"/>{{rp|107}} The goal of this organization was to expose the far-reaching dangers of tobacco, alcohol, tea, and coffee. For the 15 years that the organization persisted, Kellogg remained as its president.<ref name=\"Schwarz\"/>{{rp|107}}\n\n==Hydropathy==\n===Properties of water===\nKellogg has labeled the various uses of hydropathy as being byproducts of the many properties of water. In his 1867 book, ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease'', he acknowledges both the chemical composition and physical properties of water. Hydrogen and oxygen, when separate, are two \"colorless, transparent, and tasteless\" gases, which are explosive when mixed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Uses of Water in Health & Disease|last=Kellogg|first=John Harvey|publisher=Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer|year=1876|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}</ref> More importantly, water, he says, has the highest specific heat of any compound (although in actuality it does not). As such, the amount of heat and energy needed to elevate the temperature of water is significantly higher than that of other compounds like mercury. Kellogg addressed water's ability to absorb massive amounts of energies when shifting phases. He also highlighted water's most useful property, its ability to dissolve many other substances.<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Remedial properties of water===\nAccording to Kellogg, water provides remedial properties partly because of vital resistance and partly because of its physical properties. For Kellogg, the medical uses of water begin with its function as a refrigerant, a way to lower body heat by way of dissipating its production as well as by conduction. \"There is not a drug in the whole materia medica that will diminish the temperature of the body so readily and so efficiently as water.\"<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Water can also serve as a sedative. While other substances serve as sedatives by exerting their poisonous influences on the heart and nerves, water is a gentler and more efficient sedative without any of the negative side-effects seen in these other substances. Kellogg states that a cold bath can often reduce one's pulse by 20 to 40 beats per minute quickly, in a matter of a few minutes. Additionally, water can function as a tonic, increasing both the speed of circulation and the overall temperature of the body. A hot bath accelerates one's pulse from 70 to 150 beats per minute in 15 minutes. Water is also useful as an anodyne since it can lower nervous sensibility and reduce pain when applied in the form of hot fomentation. Kellogg argues that this procedure will often give one relief where every other drug has failed to do so. He also believed that no other treatment could function as well as an antispasmodic, reducing infantile convulsions and cramps, as water. Water can be an effective astringent as, when applied cold, it can arrest hemorrhages. Moreover, it can be very effective in producing bowel movements. Whereas purgatives would introduce \"violent and unpleasant symptoms\", water would not. Although it would not have much competition as an emetic at the time, Kellogg believed that no other substance could induce vomiting as well as water did. Returning to one of Kellogg's most admired qualities of water, it can function as a \"most perfect eliminative\". Water can dissolve waste and foreign matter from the blood. These many uses of water led Kellogg to belief that \"the aim of the faithful physician should be to accomplish for his patient the greatest amount of good at the least expence {{sic|hide=y}} of vitality; and it is an indisputable fact that in a large number of cases water is just the agent with which this desirable end can be obtained.\"<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Incorrect uses of the water cure===\nAlthough Kellogg praised hydropathy for its many uses, he did acknowledge its limits. \"In nearly all cases, sunlight, pure air, rest, exercise, proper food, and other hygienic agencies are quite as important as water. Electricity, too, is a remedy which should not be ignored; and skillful surgery is absolutely indispensable in not a small number of cases.\"<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 78.</ref> With this belief, he went on to criticize many medical figures who misused or overestimated hydropathy in the treating of disease. Among these, he criticized what he referred to as \"Cold-Water Doctors\" who would recommend the same remedy regardless of the type of ailment or temperament of the patient.<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 71.</ref> These doctors would prescribe ice-cold baths in unwarmed rooms even during the harshest winters. In his opinion, this prejudicial approach to illness resulted in converting hydropathy to a more heroic type of treatment where many became obsessed with taking baths in ice-cold water. He addresses the negative consequences that resulted from this \"infatuation\", among them tuberculosis and other diseases.<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 72.</ref> This dangerous habit was only exacerbated by physicians who used hydropathy in excess. Kellogg recounts an instance where a patient with a low typhus fever was treated with 35 cold packs while in a feeble state and, not to the surprise of Kellogg, died. Kellogg posits this excessive and dangerous use of hydropathy as a return to the \"violent processes\" of bloodletting, antimony, mercury and purgatives.<ref>Kellogg, John Harvey (1876). ''The Uses of Water in Health & Disease''. Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer. p. 74.</ref> Kellogg also criticizes the ignorance in \"Hydropathic Quacks\" as well as in Preissnitz, the founder of modern hydropathy, himself. Kellogg states that the \"Quacks\" as well as Preissnitz are ignorant for overestimating the hydropathy as a \"cure-all\" remedy without understanding the true nature of disease.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Uses of Water in Health & Disease|last=Kellogg|first=John Harvey|publisher=Battle Creek, Mich. : Office of the Health Reformer|year=1876|isbn=|location=|pages=76}}</ref>\n\n==Views on sexuality==\nBoth as a doctor and an Adventist, Kellogg was an advocate of sexual abstinence.

This was an orthodox view at the time, especially during the earlier part of his lifetime. Kellogg was able to draw upon many medical sources' claims such as \"neither the plague, nor war, nor small-pox, nor similar diseases, have produced results so disastrous to humanity as the pernicious habit of [[onanism]]\", credited to one Dr. [[Adam Clarke]]. Kellogg strongly warned against the habit in his own words, claiming of masturbation-related deaths \"such a victim literally dies by his own hand\", among other condemnations. He felt that masturbation destroyed not only physical and mental health, but moral health as well. Kellogg also believed the practice of this \"solitary-vice\" caused cancer of the womb, urinary diseases, nocturnal emissions, impotence, epilepsy, insanity, and mental and physical debility; \"dimness of vision\" was only briefly mentioned. Kellogg thought that masturbation was the worst evil one could commit; he often referred to it as \"self-abuse\".<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Money\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John Money\n | title = The Destroying Angel: Sex, Fitness, & Food in the Legacy of Degeneracy Theory, Graham Crackers, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, & American Health History\n | publisher = Prometheus Books\n | date = 1985\n | location = New York\n | pages = 85}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Kimmel\n | first = Michael\n | authorlink = Michael Kimmel\n | title = Manhood in America, a cultural history\n | url = https://archive.org/details/manhoodinamerica00kimm\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher = The Free Press\n | date = 1996\n | location = New York }}</ref>\nKellogg considered sexual climax to be a serious exhaustion of nervous energy writing \"..[sex] is accompanied by a peculiar nervous spasm, ...one more exhausting to the system than any other...\"<ref>{{cite book\n | authorlink = John Harvey Kellogg\n | title = Plain Facts for Old and Young\n | pages = 64}}</ref>\n\n===Masturbation prevention===\nAs a leader of the anti-masturbation movement, Kellogg promoted extreme measures to prevent masturbation. He circumcised himself at age 37. His methods for the \"rehabilitation\" of masturbators included measures up to the point of mutilation without anesthetic, on both sexes. He was an advocate of circumcising young boys to curb masturbation and applying [[Phenol|carbolic acid]] to a young woman's [[clitoris]]. In his ''Plain Facts for Old and Young'',<ref name=plainfacts /> he wrote:\n\n{{quote|A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of [[phimosis]]. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases. The soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and not resumed.<ref name=\"p. 325\" />}}\n\nfurther\n\n{{quote|a method of treatment [to prevent masturbation] ... and we have employed it with entire satisfaction. It consists in the application of one or more silver sutures in such a way as to prevent erection. The prepuce, or foreskin, is drawn forward over the glans, and the needle to which the wire is attached is passed through from one side to the other. After drawing the wire through, the ends are twisted together, and cut off close. It is now impossible for an erection to occur, and the slight irritation thus produced acts as a most powerful means of overcoming the disposition to resort to the practice}}\n\nand\n\n{{quote|In females, the author has found the application of pure carbolic acid ([[phenol]]) to the clitoris an excellent means of allaying the abnormal excitement.}}\n\nHe also recommended, to prevent children from this \"solitary vice\", bandaging or tying their hands, covering their genitals with patented cages and electrical shock.<ref name=plainfacts>{{cite book |title=Plain Facts for Old and Young |last=Kellogg |first=J.H. |authorlink= |year=1888 |chapter=Treatment for Self-Abuse and Its Effects |publisher=Ayer Publishing |location= |isbn= 978-0-405-05808-0 |pages=294\u2013296 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjyV7Ow6qFgC&pg=PA294}}{{gutenberg|no=19924|name=Plain Facts for Old and Young (1881 edition)}}</ref>\n\nIn his ''Ladies' Guide in Health and Disease'', for nymphomania, he recommended\n\n{{quote|Cool sitz baths; the cool enema; a spare diet; the application of blisters and other irritants to the sensitive parts of the sexual organs, the removal of the clitoris and nymphae...}}\n\n==Later life==\nKellogg would live for over 60 years after writing ''Plain Facts''. Whether he continued to teach the \"facts\" in it is not entirely clear, although it appears from the later books he wrote that he moved away from this subject matter. One source, taking a positive view of his nutritional and anti-smoking work, suggests he \"dropped his obsession with the evils of sex\" around 1920,<ref>[http://naturalhealthperspective.com/tutorials/john-kellogg.html John Harvey Kellogg<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which would be consistent with the last edition of ''Plain Facts'' being apparently published in 1917,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EQJyGQAACAAJ&dq=john+harvey+kellogg+%22plain+facts%22 Google books listing]</ref> but another, highly critical source maintains he \"never retracted his claims.\"\n\nHe did continue to work on healthy eating advice and run the sanitarium, although this was hit by the [[Great Depression]] and had to be sold. He ran another institute in Florida, which was popular throughout the rest of his life,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Biographies/Kellogg-John-Harvey.html|title=Kellogg, John Harvey|publisher=faqs.org|accessdate=April 22, 2008}}</ref> although it was a distinct step down from his Battle Creek institute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Ar-Bu/Battle-Creek-Sanitarium-Early-Health-Spa.html|title=Battle Creek Sanitarium, Early Health Spa|publisher=faqs.org|accessdate=April 22, 2008}}</ref><ref name=FEE>{{cite web|url=https://fee.org/articles/will-kellogg-king-of-corn-flakes/|title=Will Kellogg: King of Corn Flakes|publisher=Foundation for Economic Education|date=April 1998|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''Good Health'' journal===\n\nKellogg became editor of the ''Health Reformer'' journal in 1874.

In 1906, together with [[Irving Fisher]] and [[Charles Davenport]], Kellogg founded the Race Betterment Foundation, which became a major center of the new [[eugenics]] movement in America. Kellogg was in favor of racial segregation and believed that immigrants and non-whites would damage the gene pool.<ref>See ''Investigation of Race Betterment Foundation'' by the Attorney General of Michigan; also see, Ruth C.

Kellogg===\nKellogg had a long personal and business split with his brother, after fighting in court for the rights to cereal recipes. The [[Foundation for Economic Education]] records that the nonagenarian J.H. Kellogg prepared a letter seeking to reopen the relationship. His secretary decided her employer had demeaned himself in it and refused to send it.
