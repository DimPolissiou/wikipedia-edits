Judea had been ruled autonomously by the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean kings]] from 140 BC until 63 BC. The Hasmonean kings retained their titles, but became clients of Rome after the conquest by Pompey in 63 BC. Herod overthrew the Hasmonean [[Antigonus II Mattathias|Antigonus]] in a three-year-long war between 37 and 34 BC, ruled under Roman overlordship until his death ca. 4 BCE, and officially passed on the throne to his sons, thus establishing his own, so-called [[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] dynasty.\n\nHerod was granted the title of \"King of Judea\" by the [[Roman Senate]].<ref>[http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html Jewish War 1].14.4: [[Mark Antony]] \" ...then resolved to get him made king of the Jews ... told them that it was for their advantage in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars|Parthian war]] that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it.

Antony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.\"</ref> As such, he was a vassal of the Roman Empire, expected to support the interests of his Roman patrons. Nonetheless, just when Herod obtained leadership in Judea, his rule faced two threats.

Hershel Shanks. (Biblical Archaeology Society, 1999), p. 270.</ref>\n\nHerod's support from the Roman Empire was a major factor in enabling him to maintain his authority over Judea. There have been mixed interpretations concerning Herod's popularity during his reign. In ''The Jewish War'', [[Josephus]] characterizes Herod's rule in generally favorable terms, and gives Herod the benefit of the doubt for the infamous events that took place during his reign. However, in his later work, ''Jewish Antiquities'', Josephus emphasizes the tyrannical authority that many scholars have come to associate with Herod's reign.<ref name=\"SCohen271\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed. Hershel Shanks. (Biblical Archaeology Society, 1999), p. 271.</ref>\n\nHerod's despotic rule has been demonstrated by many of his security measures aimed at suppressing the contempt his people, especially Jews, had towards him. For instance, it has been suggested that Herod used secret police to monitor and report the feelings of the general populace towards him. He sought to prohibit protests, and had opponents removed by force.<ref name=\"SCohen271\"/> He had a bodyguard of 2,000 soldiers.<ref name=Guard>{{cite book |last=Rocca |first=Samuel |authorlink= |year=2009 |title=The Army of Herod the Great |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znRtCb6mXLIC |location= |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |pages=15\u201316 |isbn=978-1-8460-3206-6 |accessdate=2 November 2013 }}</ref> Josephus describes various units of Herod's personal guard taking part in Herod's funeral, including the ''Doryphnoroi'', and a [[Thracians|Thracian]], [[Celts|Celtic]] (probably [[Gauls|Gallic]]) and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] contingent.<ref name=Guard/> While the term ''Doryphnoroi'' does not have an ethnic connotation, the unit was probably composed of distinguished veteran soldiers and young men from the most influential Jewish families.<ref name=Guard/> Thracians had served in the Jewish armies since the Hasmonean dynasty, while the Celtic contingent were former bodyguards of [[Cleopatra]] given as a gift by Augustus to Herod following the [[Battle of Actium]].<ref name=Guard/> The Germanic contingent was modeled upon Augustus's personal bodyguard, the ''[[Imperial German Bodyguard (Roman)|Germani Corporis Custodes]]'', responsible for guarding the palace.<ref name=Guard/>\n\nHerod spent lavish sums on his various building projects and generous gifts to other dominions, including Rome itself. His buildings were very large, ambitious projects. Herod was responsible for the construction of the Temple Mount, a portion of which remains today as the Western Wall. In addition, Herod also used the latest technology in [[hydraulic cement]] and underwater construction to build the harbor at [[Caesarea]].<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> While Herod's zeal for building transformed Judea, his motives were not selfless. Although he built fortresses ([[Masada]], [[Herodium]], Alexandrium, Hyrcania, and [[Machaerus]]) in which he and his family could take refuge in case of insurrection, these vast projects were also intended to gain the support of the Jews and improve his reputation as a leader.<ref name=\"CohenShaye\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed.

In Jerusalem, Herod introduced foreign forms of entertainment, and erected a golden eagle at the entrance of the Temple, which suggested a greater interest in the welfare of Rome than of Jews.<ref name=\"AJLevine\"/> Herod's taxes garnered a bad reputation\u2014his constant concern for his reputation led him to make frequent, expensive gifts, increasingly emptying the kingdom's coffers, and such lavish spending upset his Jewish subjects.<ref name=\"CohenShaye\" /> The two major Jewish sects of the day, the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]], both showed opposition to Herod. The Pharisees were discontented because Herod disregarded many of their demands with respect to the Temple's construction. The Sadducees, who were closely associated with priestly responsibilities in the Temple, opposed Herod because he replaced their high priests with outsiders from [[Babylonia]] and Alexandria, in an effort to gain support from the Jewish Diaspora.<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence H. \"The Jewish\u2013Christian Schism,\" in ''From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism'' (Hoboken: Ktav Publishing House, 1991), p. 145.</ref> Herod's outreach efforts gained him little, and at the end of his reign anger and dissatisfaction were common amongst Jews. Heavy outbreaks of violence and riots followed Herod's death in many cities, including Jerusalem, as pent-up resentments boiled over. The scope of the disturbances sparked hopes that the Jews of Judea might some day overthrow the Roman overlords, hopes reawakened decades later in the outbreak of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Great Revolt of 70 CE]].<ref name=\"CohenShaye\" />\n\n==Architectural achievements==\n{{Main|Herodian architecture}}\n\nHerod's most famous and ambitious project was the expansion of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem.  Herod's rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem was done so that he would \"have a capital city worthy of his dignity and grandeur\"<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> and with this reconstruction Herod hoped to gain more support from the Jews.<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> Recent findings suggest that the Temple Mount walls and [[Robinson's Arch]] may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death, during the reign of [[Herod Agrippa II]].<ref name=Western>{{cite web|title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn't Finish it (december 2011)|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&subj_id=240&id=1882&hist=1|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th year of his reign (20\u201319 BC), Herod rebuilt the Temple on \"a more magnificent scale\".<ref name=temple>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=123&letter=T&search=Herod's%20Temple Temple of Herod] at ''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>  Although work on out-buildings and courts continued for another 80 years, the new Temple was finished in a year and a half.<ref>Graetz, Heinrich (1893) \"History of the Jews: From the Reign of Hyrcanus (135 BC) to the Completion of the Babylonian Talmud (500 AD)\", Cosimo Books, New York, Volume 2, 2009 ed, p.109</ref> To comply with religious law, Herod employed 1,000 priests as masons and carpenters in the rebuilding.<ref name=temple/> The finished temple, which was destroyed in 70 AD, is sometimes referred to as [[Herod's Temple]]. Today, only the four retaining walls remain standing, including the [[Western Wall]]. These walls created a flat platform (the Temple Mount) upon which the Temple was then constructed.\n\nHerod's other achievements include the development of water supplies for Jerusalem, building fortresses such as [[Masada]] and [[Herodium]], and founding new cities such as [[Caesarea Maritima]] and the enclosures of [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] and [[Mamre]] in [[Hebron]]. He and Cleopatra owned a monopoly over the extraction of [[asphalt]] from the Dead Sea, which was used in shipbuilding. He leased [[copper]] mines on [[Cyprus]] from the Roman emperor.\n\n==New Testament references==\n{{Main|Massacre of the Innocents}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 172.png|thumbnail|Massacre of the Innocents by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]], 1860]]\nHerod appears in the [[Gospel of Matthew]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|2:1\u201323|NRSV}}</ref> which describes an event known as the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. According to this account, after the birth of [[Jesus]], [[Biblical magi|some magi from the East]] visited Herod to inquire the whereabouts of \"the one having been born king of the Jews\", because they had seen his star in the east (or, according to certain translations, at its rising) and therefore wanted to pay him homage. Herod, as King of the Jews, was alarmed at the prospect of a usurper. Herod assembled the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the \"Anointed One\" (the [[Messiah]], Greek: \u1f49 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, ''ho Christos'') was to be born. They answered, in [[Bethlehem]], citing [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy#Micah 5:2|Micah 5:2]]. Herod therefore sent the magi to Bethlehem, instructing them to search for the child and, after they had found him, to \"report to me, so that I too may go and worship him\". However, after they had found Jesus, they were warned in a dream not to report back to Herod. Similarly, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] was warned in a dream that Herod intended to kill Jesus, so he and his family fled to Egypt. When Herod realized he had been outwitted, he gave orders to kill all boys of the age of two and under in Bethlehem and its vicinity. Joseph and his family stayed in Egypt until Herod's death, then moved to [[Nazareth]] in Galilee to avoid living under Herod's son [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]].\n\nMost modern biographers of Herod, and probably a majority of biblical scholars, dismiss Matthew's story as an invention.<ref>{{Cite book| last      = Maier| first     = Paul L.| chapter   = Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem| editor1-last  = Summers | editor1-first = Ray | editor2-last  = Vardaman| editor2-first = Jerry | title     = Chronos, Kairos, Christos II: Chronological, Nativity, and Religious Studies in Memory of Ray Summers| publisher = Mercer University Press| year      = 1998| chapter-url       = https://books.google.com/?id=mWnYvI5RdLMC&pg=PA169&dq=Herod+and+the+Infants+of+Bethlehem#v=onepage&q=Herod%20and%20the%20Infants%20of%20Bethlehem&f=false| pages       = 170\u2013171| isbn      = 978-0865545823| ref       = harv}}</ref> Contemporary non-biblical sources, including Herod's friend and personal historian, Nicolas of Damascus, provide no corroboration for Matthew's account of the massacre,<ref name=sanders>[[E.

Although Herod considered himself king of the Jews, he let it be known that he also represented the non-Jews living in Judea, building temples for other religions outside of the Jewish areas of his kingdom. Many Jews questioned the authenticity of Herod's Judaism on account of his [[Idumean]] background and his infamous murders of members of his family. However, he generally respected traditional Jewish observances in his public life.

There have been mixed interpretations concerning Herod's popularity during his reign. In ''The Jewish War'', [[Josephus]] characterizes Herod's rule in generally favorable terms, and gives Herod the benefit of the doubt for the infamous events that took place during his reign. However, in his later work, ''Jewish Antiquities'', Josephus emphasizes the tyrannical authority that many scholars have come to associate with Herod's reign.<ref name=\"SCohen271\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed. Hershel Shanks. (Biblical Archaeology Society, 1999), p. 271.</ref>\n\nHerod's despotic rule has been demonstrated by many of his security measures aimed at suppressing the contempt his people, especially Jews, had towards him. For instance, it has been suggested that Herod used secret police to monitor and report the feelings of the general populace towards him. He sought to prohibit protests, and had opponents removed by force.<ref name=\"SCohen271\"/> He had a bodyguard of 2,000 soldiers.<ref name=Guard>{{cite book |last=Rocca |first=Samuel |authorlink= |year=2009 |title=The Army of Herod the Great |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znRtCb6mXLIC |location= |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |pages=15\u201316 |isbn=978-1-8460-3206-6 |accessdate=2 November 2013 }}</ref> Josephus describes various units of Herod's personal guard taking part in Herod's funeral, including the ''Doryphnoroi'', and a [[Thracians|Thracian]], [[Celts|Celtic]] (probably [[Gauls|Gallic]]) and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] contingent.<ref name=Guard/> While the term ''Doryphnoroi'' does not have an ethnic connotation, the unit was probably composed of distinguished veteran soldiers and young men from the most influential Jewish families.<ref name=Guard/> Thracians had served in the Jewish armies since the Hasmonean dynasty, while the Celtic contingent were former bodyguards of [[Cleopatra]] given as a gift by Augustus to Herod following the [[Battle of Actium]].<ref name=Guard/> The Germanic contingent was modeled upon Augustus's personal bodyguard, the ''[[Imperial German Bodyguard (Roman)|Germani Corporis Custodes]]'', responsible for guarding the palace.<ref name=Guard/>\n\nHerod spent lavish sums on his various building projects and generous gifts to other dominions, including Rome itself. His buildings were very large, ambitious projects. Herod was responsible for the construction of the Temple Mount, a portion of which remains today as the Western Wall. In addition, Herod also used the latest technology in [[hydraulic cement]] and underwater construction to build the harbor at [[Caesarea]].<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> While Herod's zeal for building transformed Judea, his motives were not selfless. Although he built fortresses ([[Masada]], [[Herodium]], Alexandrium, Hyrcania, and [[Machaerus]]) in which he and his family could take refuge in case of insurrection, these vast projects were also intended to gain the support of the Jews and improve his reputation as a leader.<ref name=\"CohenShaye\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed.

In Jerusalem, Herod introduced foreign forms of entertainment, and erected a golden eagle at the entrance of the Temple, which suggested a greater interest in the welfare of Rome than of Jews.<ref name=\"AJLevine\"/> Herod's taxes garnered a bad reputation\u2014his constant concern for his reputation led him to make frequent, expensive gifts, increasingly emptying the kingdom's coffers, and such lavish spending upset his Jewish subjects.<ref name=\"CohenShaye\" /> The two major Jewish sects of the day, the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]], both showed opposition to Herod. The Pharisees were discontented because Herod disregarded many of their demands with respect to the Temple's construction. The Sadducees, who were closely associated with priestly responsibilities in the Temple, opposed Herod because he replaced their high priests with outsiders from [[Babylonia]] and Alexandria, in an effort to gain support from the Jewish Diaspora.<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence H. \"The Jewish\u2013Christian Schism,\" in ''From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism'' (Hoboken: Ktav Publishing House, 1991), p. 145.</ref> Herod's outreach efforts gained him little, and at the end of his reign anger and dissatisfaction were common amongst Jews. Heavy outbreaks of violence and riots followed Herod's death in many cities, including Jerusalem, as pent-up resentments boiled over. The scope of the disturbances sparked hopes that the Jews of Judea might some day overthrow the Roman overlords, hopes reawakened decades later in the outbreak of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Great Revolt of 70 CE]].<ref name=\"CohenShaye\" />\n\n==Architectural achievements==\n{{Main|Herodian architecture}}\n\nHerod's most famous and ambitious project was the expansion of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem.  Herod's rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem was done so that he would \"have a capital city worthy of his dignity and grandeur\"<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> and with this reconstruction Herod hoped to gain more support from the Jews.<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> Recent findings suggest that the Temple Mount walls and [[Robinson's Arch]] may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death, during the reign of [[Herod Agrippa II]].<ref name=Western>{{cite web|title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn't Finish it (december 2011)|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&subj_id=240&id=1882&hist=1|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th year of his reign (20\u201319 BCE), Herod rebuilt the Temple on \"a more magnificent scale\".<ref name=temple>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=123&letter=T&search=Herod's%20Temple Temple of Herod] at ''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>  Although work on out-buildings and courts continued for another 80 years, the new Temple was finished in a year and a half.<ref>Graetz, Heinrich (1893) \"History of the Jews: From the Reign of Hyrcanus (135 BCE) to the Completion of the Babylonian Talmud (500 AD)\", Cosimo Books, New York, Volume 2, 2009 ed, p.109</ref> To comply with religious law, Herod employed 1,000 priests as masons and carpenters in the rebuilding.<ref name=temple/> The finished temple, which was destroyed in 70 CE, is sometimes referred to as [[Herod's Temple]]. Today, only the four retaining walls remain standing, including the [[Western Wall]]. These walls created a flat platform (the Temple Mount) upon which the Temple was then constructed.\n\nHerod's other achievements include the development of water supplies for Jerusalem, building fortresses such as [[Masada]] and [[Herodium]], and founding new cities such as [[Caesarea Maritima]] and the enclosures of [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] and [[Mamre]] in [[Hebron]]. He and Cleopatra owned a monopoly over the extraction of [[asphalt]] from the Dead Sea, which was used in shipbuilding. He leased [[copper]] mines on [[Cyprus]] from the Roman emperor.\n\n==New Testament references==\n{{Main|Massacre of the Innocents}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 172.png|thumbnail|Massacre of the Innocents by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]], 1860]]\nHerod appears in the [[Gospel of Matthew]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|2:1\u201323|NRSV}}</ref> which describes an event known as the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. According to this account, after the birth of [[Jesus]], [[Biblical magi|some magi from the East]] visited Herod to inquire the whereabouts of \"the one having been born king of the Jews\", because they had seen his star in the east (or, according to certain translations, at its rising) and therefore wanted to pay him homage. Herod, as King of the Jews, was alarmed at the prospect of a usurper. Herod assembled the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the \"Anointed One\" (the [[Messiah]], Greek: \u1f49 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, ''ho Christos'') was to be born. They answered, in [[Bethlehem]], citing [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy#Micah 5:2|Micah 5:2]]. Herod therefore sent the magi to Bethlehem, instructing them to search for the child and, after they had found him, to \"report to me, so that I too may go and worship him\". However, after they had found Jesus, they were warned in a dream not to report back to Herod. Similarly, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] was warned in a dream that Herod intended to kill Jesus, so he and his family fled to Egypt. When Herod realized he had been outwitted, he gave orders to kill all boys of the age of two and under in Bethlehem and its vicinity.

Herod then executed his son, and again changed his will: [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]] (from the marriage with Malthace) would rule as ethnarch over the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrachy of Judea]], while [[Herod Antipas|Antipas]] (by Malthace) and [[Herod Philip II|Philip]] (from the fifth marriage with Cleopatra of Jerusalem) would rule as tetrarchs over Galilee and [[Perea (Holy Land)|Peraea]] (Transjordan), also over Gaulanitis ([[Golan]]), [[Trachonitis]] (Hebrew: Argob), Batanaea (now Ard-el-Bathanyeh) and [[Panias]]. [[Salome I]] was also given a small [[toparchy]] in the Gaza region. As Augustus did not confirm his will, no one received the title of King; however, the three sons were granted rule of the stated territories.\n\n==Wives and children==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Herod's wives and children'''\n!

When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a [[mobile device]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Web-based Mobile Apps of the Future Using HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript|publisher=HTMLGoodies|url=http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/article.php/3893911/Web-based-Mobile-Apps-of-the-Future-Using-HTML-5-CSS-and-JavaScript.htm|access-date=2014-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020121735/http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/article.php/3893911/Web-based-Mobile-Apps-of-the-Future-Using-HTML-5-CSS-and-JavaScript.htm|archive-date=2014-10-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''cascading'' comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.\n\nThe CSS specifications are maintained by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C). Internet media type ([[MIME media type|MIME type]]) <code>text/css</code> is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free [[W3C Markup Validation Service#CSS validation|CSS validation service]] for CSS documents.<ref>{{cite web | title = W3C CSS validation service | url = http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ | access-date = 2012-06-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110214164625/http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ | archive-date = 2011-02-14 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including [[XHTML]], [[Plain Old XML|plain XML]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], and [[XUL]].\n\n==Syntax==\nCSS has a simple [[syntax]] and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.\n\nA style sheet consists of a list of ''rules''. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more ''selectors'', and a ''declaration block''.\n\n===Selector===\nIn CSS, ''selectors'' declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.\n\nSelectors may apply to the following:\n*all [[HTML element|elements]] of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers [[HTML element#Basic text|h2]]\n*elements specified by [[HTML attribute|attribute]], in particular:\n**''id'': an identifier unique within the document\n**''class'': an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document\n*elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the [[Document Object Model|document tree]].\n\nClasses and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.\n\n''Pseudo-classes'' are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is {{code|lang=css|:hover}}, which identifies content only when the user \"points to\" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in {{code|lang=css|code=a:hover}} or {{code|lang=css|code=#elementid:hover}}. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as {{code|lang=css|code=:link}} or {{code|lang=css|code=:visited}}, whereas a ''pseudo-element'' makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as {{code|lang=css|code=::first-line}} or {{code|lang=css|code=::first-letter}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#pseudo-elements |title=W3C CSS2.1 specification for pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |date=7 June 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430011514/http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#pseudo-elements |archive-date=30 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSelectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.<ref>see [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html the complete definition of selectors at the W3C Web site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423174213/http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html |date=2006-04-23 }}.</ref> Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, <syntaxhighlight inline lang=css class=nowrap>\ndiv .myClass {color: red;}</syntaxhighlight> applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas <syntaxhighlight inline lang=css class=nowrap>.myClass div {color: red;}</syntaxhighlight> applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/ |title=Selectors Level 3 |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2014-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603165900/http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/ |archive-date=2014-06-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.\n\nFor example, headings (<code>h1</code> elements), sub-headings (<code>h2</code>), sub-sub-headings (<code>h3</code>), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of [[Typeface|font]], [[Point (typography)|size]], [[color]] and [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]] for these elements is ''presentational''.\n\nBefore CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such [[Typography|typographic]] characteristics to, say, all <code>h2</code> headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The [[W3C]] has now [[deprecation|deprecated]] the use of all presentational HTML markup.<ref>{{cite web|author=W3C HTML Working Group|title=HTML 5. A vocabulary and associated APIs for HTML and XHTML|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html/introduction.html#presentational-markup|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=28 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001359/http://www.w3.org/TR/html/introduction.html#presentational-markup|archive-date=15 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFor example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<h1><font color=\"red\"> Chapter 1. </font></h1>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nUsing CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational attributes:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\">\n<h1 style=\"color: red;\"> Chapter 1. </h1>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For example, suppose the document contains the style element:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<style>\nh1 {\n    color: red;\n}\n</style>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAll <code>h1</code> elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to make <code>h1</code> elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style element to:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<style>\nh1 {\n    color: blue;\n}\n</style>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nrather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual <code>h1</code> element.\n\nThe styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax similar to:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<link href=\"path/to/file.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis further decouples the styling from the HTML document, and makes it possible to restyle multiple documents by simply editing a shared external CSS file.\n\n===Sources===\nCSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type, importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.\n\nThe style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style. The process is called ''cascading''.\n\nOne of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red italic headings difficult to read may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and the web site, a user may choose from various style sheets provided by the designers, or may remove all added styles and view the site using the browser's default styling, or may override just the red italic heading style without altering other attributes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ CSS priority scheme (highest to lowest)\n|-\n! Priority !! CSS source type !! Description\n|-\n| 1 || Importance || The \"{{code|lang=css|code=!important}}\" annotation overwrites the previous priority types\n|-\n| 2 || Inline || A style applied to an HTML element via HTML \"style\" attribute\n|-\n| 3 || Media Type || A property definition applies to all media types, unless a media specific CSS is defined\n|-\n| 4 || User defined || Most browsers have the accessibility feature: a user defined CSS\n|-\n| 5 || Selector specificity || A specific contextual selector ({{code|lang=css|code=#heading p}}) overwrites generic definition\n|-\n| 6 || Rule order || Last rule declaration has a higher priority\n|-\n| 7 || Parent inheritance || If a property is not specified, it is inherited from a parent element\n|-\n| 8 || CSS property definition in HTML document || CSS rule or CSS inline style overwrites a default browser value\n|-\n| 9 || Browser default || The lowest priority: browser default value is determined by W3C initial value specifications\n|}\n\n===Specificity===\n''Specificity'' refers to the relative weights of various rules.<ref name=\"Cascading\">{{Cite book | edition = 3rd | publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc. | isbn = 0-596-52733-0 | last = Meyer | first = Eric A. | title = Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide | url = http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565926226.do | year = 2006 | access-date = 2014-02-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140215041138/http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565926226.do | archive-date = 2014-02-15 | url-status = live }}</ref> It determines which styles apply to an element when more than one rule could apply.  Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has a specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID selectors a specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to separate the \"digits\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity|title=Assigning property values, Cascading, and Inheritance|publisher=|access-date=2014-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611010536/http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity|archive-date=2014-06-11|url-status=live}}</ref> (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have a specificity of 11,11, not 121).\n\nThus the following rules selectors result in the indicated specificity:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Selectors !! Specificity\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>H1 {color: white;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 0, 1\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>P EM {color: green;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 0, 2\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>.grape {color: red;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 1, 0\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>P.bright {color: blue;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 1, 1\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>P.bright EM.dark {color: yellow;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 2, 2\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>#id218 {color: brown;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 1, 0, 0\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>style=\" \"</syntaxhighlight> || 1, 0, 0, 0\n|}\n\n====Examples====\n\nConsider this HTML fragment:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"HTML5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <style>\n    #xyz { color: blue; }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p id=\"xyz\" style=\"color: green;\"> To demonstrate specificity </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIn the above example, the declaration in the <code>style</code> attribute overrides the one in the <code><style></code> element because it has a higher specificity, and thus, the paragraph appears green.\n\n===Inheritance===\nInheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.<ref name=\"Cascading\"/> Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of [[XHTML]] elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them.\nIn general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but their box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.\n\nInheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and over again in a style sheet, allowing for shorter CSS.\n\nInheritance in CSS is not the same as [[Class-based programming#Inheritance|inheritance in class-based programming languages]], where it is possible to define class B as \"like class A, but with modifications\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Can a CSS class inherit one or more other classes?|url = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1065435/can-a-css-class-inherit-one-or-more-other-classes|website = StackOverflow|accessdate = 2017-09-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171014054727/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1065435/can-a-css-class-inherit-one-or-more-other-classes|archive-date = 2017-10-14|url-status = live}}</ref> With CSS, it is possible to style an ''element'' with \"class A, but with modifications\". However, it is not possible to define a CSS ''class'' B like that, which could then be used to style multiple elements without having to repeat the modifications.\n\n====Example====\nGiven the following style sheet:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\">\nh1 {\n   color: pink;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nSuppose there is an h1 element with an emphasizing element (em) inside:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<h1>\n   This is to <em>illustrate</em> inheritance\n</h1>\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIf no color is assigned to the em element, the emphasized word \"illustrate\" inherits the color of the parent element, h1. The style sheet h1 has the color pink, hence, the em element is likewise pink.\n\n===Whitespace===\n\nWhitespace between properties and selectors is ignored. This code snippet:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">\nbody{overflow:hidden;background:#000000;background-image:url(images/bg.gif);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:left top;}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nis functionally equivalent to this one:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">\nbody {\n   overflow: hidden;\n   background-color: #000000;\n   background-image: url(images/bg.gif);\n   background-repeat: no-repeat;\n   background-position: left top;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nOne common way to format CSS for readability is to indent each property and give it its own line. In addition to formatting CSS for readability, shorthand properties can be used to write out the code faster, which also gets processed more quickly when being rendered:<ref name=\"Mozilla Developers\">{{cite news |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties |title=Shorthand properties |work=Tutorial |publisher=Mozilla Developers |date=2017-12-07 |access-date=2018-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130204516/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties |archive-date=2018-01-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">\nbody {\n   overflow: hidden;\n   background: #000 url(images/bg.gif) no-repeat left top;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Positioning===\nCSS&nbsp;2.1 defines three positioning schemes:\n;Normal flow: ''Inline'' items are laid out in the same way as the letters in words in text, one after the other across the available space until there is no more room, then starting a new line below. ''Block'' items stack vertically, like paragraphs and like the items in a bulleted list. Normal flow also includes relative positioning of block or inline items, and run-in boxes.\n;Floats: A floated item is taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible in the space available. Other content then flows alongside the floated item.\n;Absolute positioning: An absolutely positioned item has no place in, and no effect on, the normal flow of other items. It occupies its assigned position in its container independently of other items.<ref name=\"W3C-positioning\">{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Bert|title=9.3 Positioning schemes|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#positioning-scheme|work=Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification|publisher=W3C|accessdate=16 February 2011|date=7 December 2010|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218054848/http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#positioning-scheme|archive-date=18 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Position property====\nThere are four possible values of the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\" inline>position</syntaxhighlight> property.

Subsequent flow items are laid out as if the item had not been moved.\n;Absolute: Specifies ''absolute positioning''. The element is positioned in relation to its nearest non-static ancestor.\n;Fixed: The item is ''absolutely positioned'' in a fixed position on the screen even as the rest of the document is scrolled<ref name=\"W3C-positioning\"/>\n\n====Float and clear====\nThe <code>float</code> property may have one of three values. ''Absolutely'' positioned or ''fixed'' items cannot be floated. Other elements normally flow around floated items, unless they are prevented from doing so by their <code>clear</code> property.\n\n;left: The item ''floats'' to the left of the line that it would have appeared in; other items may flow around its right side.\n;right: The item ''floats'' to the right of the line that it would have appeared in; other items may flow around its left side.\n;clear: Forces the element to appear underneath ('clear') floated elements to the left ({{code|lang=css|code=clear:left}}), right ({{code|lang=css|code=clear:right}}) or both sides ({{code|lang=css|code=clear:both}}).<ref name=\"W3C-positioning\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Holzschlag|first=Molly E|authorlink=Molly Holzschlag|title=Spring into HTML and CSS|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc|isbn=0-13-185586-7}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:H\u00e5kon Wium Lie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[H\u00e5kon Wium Lie]], chief technical officer of the Opera Software company and co-creator of the CSS web standards]]\n\nCSS was first proposed by [[H\u00e5kon Wium Lie]] on October 10, 1994.<ref name=\"chss-proposal\">{{cite journal|last=Lie|first=Hakon W|title=Cascading HTML style sheets - a proposal|date=10 Oct 1994|issue=0.92|url=http://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html|accessdate=25 May 2014|publisher=CERN|format=Proposal|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604022945/http://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html|archive-date=4 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> At the time, Lie was working with [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]].<ref name=\"chapter20\">{{cite book|title=Cascading Style Sheets, designing for the Web|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=0-201-59625-3|url=https://archive.org/details/cascadingstyles000lieh|accessdate=23 June 2010|authorlink1=H\u00e5kon Wium Lie|first1=H\u00e5kon Wium|last1=Lie|authorlink2=Bert Bos|first2=Bert|last2=Bos}}</ref> Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside [[World Wide Web Consortium]] resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)<ref name=\"w3c-css1\">{{cite web|title=Cascading Style Sheets, level 1|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-CSS1-19990111|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|access-date=2014-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409234430/http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-CSS1-19990111|archive-date=2014-04-09|url-status=live}}</ref> being released in 1996.

It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by [[Steven Pemberton]]. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including [[Thomas Reardon]] of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996, [[Netscape|Netscape Communication Corporation]] presented an alternative style sheet language called [[JavaScript Style Sheets]] (JSSS).<ref name=\"chapter20\" /> The spec was never finished, and is deprecated.<ref>{{cite web|title=JavaScript-Based Style Sheets|url=http://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822|publisher=W3C|accessdate=23 June 2010|author=[[Lou Montulli]]|author2=[[Brendan Eich]]|author3=[[Scott Furman]]|author4=[[Donna Converse]]|author5=[[Troy Chevalier]]|date=22 August 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527213412/http://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822|archive-date=27 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.\n\nDevelopment of HTML, CSS, and the [[Document Object Model|DOM]] had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: [[HTML Working group]], chaired by [[Dan Connolly (computer scientist)|Dan Connolly]] of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of [[SoftQuad]]; and [[CSS Working group]], chaired by [[Chris Lilley (W3C)|Chris Lilley]] of W3C.\n\nThe CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.\n\nIn 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant that already published standards like CSS&nbsp;2.1, CSS&nbsp;3 Selectors, and CSS&nbsp;3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.\n\n===Difficulty with adoption===\n{{Outdated|date=January 2019}}\nThe CSS&nbsp;1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer 3]]<ref name=\"chapter20\" /> was released in that year, featuring some limited support for CSS.  [[Internet Explorer 4|IE 4]] and [[Netscape Navigator|Netscape 4.x]] added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had many [[Software bug|bugs]] that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification. [[Internet Explorer for Mac|Internet Explorer 5.0]] for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], shipped in March 2000, was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS&nbsp;1 support,<ref>{{cite web|title=CSS software|publisher=W3.org|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/software.en.html#w26|accessdate=2011-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125162013/http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/software.en.html#w26|archive-date=2010-11-25|url-status=live}}</ref> surpassing [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterwards, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS&nbsp;2.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHowever, even when later 'version 5' web browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain areas and were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs and other [[Quirks mode|quirks]]. [[Internet Explorer 5|Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x for Windows]], as opposed to the very different [[Internet Explorer for Mac|IE for Macintosh]], had a flawed implementation of the '[[CSS box model]]', as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across browsers and [[Computing platform|platform]]s without the use of [[workaround]]s termed [[CSS hack|CSS hacks and filters]]. The IE/Windows box model bugs were so serious that, when [[Internet Explorer 6]] was released, Microsoft introduced a backwards-compatible mode of CSS interpretation ('[[quirks mode]]') alongside an alternative, corrected 'standards mode'. Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided such 'mode'-switch behavior capability. It therefore became necessary for authors of [[HTML]] files to ensure they contained special distinctive [[Document type declaration#HTML5 DTD-less DOCTYPE|'standards-compliant CSS intended' marker]] to show that the authors intended CSS to be interpreted correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now long-obsolete [[Internet Explorer 5|IE5/Windows browser]]. Without this marker, web browsers that have the 'quirks mode'-switching capability will size objects in web pages as IE5/Windows would rather than following CSS standards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nProblems with patchy adoption of CSS, along with errata in the original specification, led the W3C to revise the CSS&nbsp;2 standard into CSS&nbsp;2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS&nbsp;2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations.

Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known as [[CSS hacks]] or CSS filters). Adoption of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/css3-solutions-for-internet-explorer/|title=CSS3 Solutions for Internet Explorer \u2013 Smashing Magazine|date=2010-04-28|newspaper=Smashing Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012224430/https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/css3-solutions-for-internet-explorer/|archive-date=2016-10-12|url-status=live}}</ref> In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing development time and complexity. Tools such as [[BrowserStack]] have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments.\n\nIn addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of browser support for specific CSS properties, including [http://caniuse.com/ CanIUse] and the [[Mozilla Developer Network]]. Additionally, the CSS 3 defines feature queries, which provide an <code>@supports</code> directive that will allow developers to target browsers with support for certain functionality directly within their CSS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/|title=Using Feature Queries in CSS \u2605         Mozilla Hacks \u2013 the Web developer blog|website=hacks.mozilla.org|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011151259/https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/|archive-date=2016-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref> CSS that is not supported by older browsers can also sometimes be patched in using JavaScript [[Polyfill (programming)|polyfill]]s, which are pieces of JavaScript code designed to make browsers behave consistently.

One CSS pseudo-class, \"{{code|lang=css|code=:hover}}\", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript \"onmouseover\") and has potential for abuse (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html |title=Pure CSS Popups |publisher=meyerweb.com |accessdate=2009-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209071014/http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html |archive-date=2009-12-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no \"disable\"-like property) or limit its effects (no \"nochange\"-like values for each property).\n; Cannot name rules: There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes.\n; Cannot include styles from a rule into another rule: CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules to achieve a desired effect, causing additional maintenance and requiring more thorough testing.

Nominal parameters include explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of device being used to view the content (a desktop computer or mobile device), the geographic location of the user and many other variables.\n;Site-wide consistency: {{Main article|Style sheet (web development)}} \n:When CSS is used effectively, in terms of inheritance and \"cascading\", a global style sheet can be used to affect and style elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the styling of the elements should be changed or adjusted, these changes can be made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS, this sort of maintenance was more difficult, expensive and time-consuming.\n;Bandwidth: A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a range of HTML elements selected by <code>class</code>, type or relationship to others. This is much more efficient than repeating style information inline for each occurrence of the element. An external stylesheet is usually stored in the [[browser cache]], and can therefore be used on multiple pages without being reloaded, further reducing data transfer over a network.\n;Page reformatting: {{Main article|Progressive enhancement}}\n:With a simple change of one line, a different style sheet can be used for the same page. This has advantages for accessibility, as well as providing the ability to tailor a page or site to different target devices. Furthermore, devices not able to understand the styling still display the content.\n;Accessibility: Without CSS, web designers must typically lay out their pages with techniques such as HTML tables that hinder accessibility for vision-impaired users (see [[Tableless web design#Accessibility]]).\n\n==Standardization==\n===Frameworks===\n{{Main article|CSS framework}}\n[[CSS framework]]s are pre-prepared [[Library (computing)|libraries]] that are meant to allow for easier, more [[standards-compliant]] styling of [[web page]]s using the Cascading Style Sheets language. CSS frameworks include [[Foundation (framework)|Foundation]], [[Blueprint (CSS framework)|Blueprint]], [[Bootstrap (framework)|Bootstrap]], [[Cascade Framework]] and Materialize. Like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks are usually incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML {{code|lang=html|code=<head>}}. They provide a number of ready-made options for designing and laying out the web page. Although many of these frameworks have been published, some authors use them mostly for rapid prototyping, or for learning from, and prefer to 'handcraft' CSS that is appropriate to each published site without the design, maintenance and download overhead of having many unused features in the site's styling.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cederholm|first=Dan|title=Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design|year=2009|publisher=New Riders|isbn=978-0-321-64338-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgrUeIwsS60C&pg=PA114|author2=Ethan Marcotte|accessdate=19 June 2010|page=114|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220221903/http://books.google.com/books?id=UgrUeIwsS60C&pg=PA114|archive-date=20 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Design methodologies===\nAs the size of CSS resources used in a project increases, a development team often needs to decide on a common design methodology to keep them organized. The goals are ease of development, ease of collaboration during development and performance of the deployed stylesheets in the browser. Popular methodologies include OOCSS (object oriented CSS), ACSS (atomic CSS), oCSS (organic Cascade Style Sheet), SMACSS (scalable and modular architecture for CSS), and BEM (block, element, modifier).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Antti|first1=Hilj\u00e1|title=OOCSS, ACSS, BEM, SMACSS: what are they?

CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a [[mobile device]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Web-based Mobile Apps of the Future Using HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript|publisher=HTMLGoodies|url=http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/article.php/3893911/Web-based-Mobile-Apps-of-the-Future-Using-HTML-5-CSS-and-JavaScript.htm|access-date=2014-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020121735/http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/article.php/3893911/Web-based-Mobile-Apps-of-the-Future-Using-HTML-5-CSS-and-JavaScript.htm|archive-date=2014-10-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''cascading'' comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.\n\nThe CSS specifications are maintained by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C). Internet media type ([[MIME media type|MIME type]]) <code>text/css</code> is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free [[W3C Markup Validation Service#CSS validation|CSS validation service]] for CSS documents.<ref>{{cite web | title = W3C CSS validation service | url = http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ | access-date = 2012-06-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110214164625/http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ | archive-date = 2011-02-14 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including [[XHTML]], [[Plain Old XML|plain XML]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], and [[XUL]].\n\n==Syntax==\nCSS has a simple [[syntax]] and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.\n\nA style sheet consists of a list of ''rules''. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more ''selectors'', and a ''declaration block''.\n\n===Selector===\nIn CSS, ''selectors'' declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.\n\nSelectors may apply to the following:\n*all [[HTML element|elements]] of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers [[HTML element#Basic text|h2]]\n*elements specified by [[HTML attribute|attribute]], in particular:\n**''id'': an identifier unique within the document\n**''class'': an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document\n*elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the [[Document Object Model|document tree]].\n\nClasses and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.\n\n''Pseudo-classes'' are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is {{code|lang=css|:hover}}, which identifies content only when the user \"points to\" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in {{code|lang=css|code=a:hover}} or {{code|lang=css|code=#elementid:hover}}. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as {{code|lang=css|code=:link}} or {{code|lang=css|code=:visited}}, whereas a ''pseudo-element'' makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as {{code|lang=css|code=::first-line}} or {{code|lang=css|code=::first-letter}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#pseudo-elements |title=W3C CSS2.1 specification for pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |date=7 June 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430011514/http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#pseudo-elements |archive-date=30 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSelectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.<ref>see [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html the complete definition of selectors at the W3C Web site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423174213/http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html |date=2006-04-23 }}.</ref> Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important.

All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.\n\nFor example, headings (<code>h1</code> elements), sub-headings (<code>h2</code>), sub-sub-headings (<code>h3</code>), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of [[Typeface|font]], [[Point (typography)|size]], [[color]] and [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]] for these elements is ''presentational''.\n\nBefore CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such [[Typography|typographic]] characteristics to, say, all <code>h2</code> headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The [[W3C]] has now [[deprecation|deprecated]] the use of all presentational HTML markup.<ref>{{cite web|author=W3C HTML Working Group|title=HTML 5. A vocabulary and associated APIs for HTML and XHTML|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html/introduction.html#presentational-markup|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=28 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001359/http://www.w3.org/TR/html/introduction.html#presentational-markup|archive-date=15 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFor example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<h1><font color=\"red\"> Chapter 1. </font></h1>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nUsing CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational attributes:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\">\n<h1 style=\"color: red;\"> Chapter 1. </h1>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For example, suppose the document contains the style element:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<style>\nh1 {\n    color: red;\n}\n</style>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAll <code>h1</code> elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to make <code>h1</code> elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style element to:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<style>\nh1 {\n    color: blue;\n}\n</style>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nrather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual <code>h1</code> element.\n\nThe styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax similar to:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<link href=\"path/to/file.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis further decouples the styling from the HTML document, and makes it possible to restyle multiple documents by simply editing a shared external CSS file.\n\n===Sources===\nCSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type, importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.\n\nThe style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style. The process is called ''cascading''.\n\nOne of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red italic headings difficult to read may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and the web site, a user may choose from various style sheets provided by the designers, or may remove all added styles and view the site using the browser's default styling, or may override just the red italic heading style without altering other attributes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ CSS priority scheme (highest to lowest)\n|-\n! Priority !! CSS source type !! Description\n|-\n| 1 || Importance || The \"{{code|lang=css|code=!important}}\" annotation overwrites the previous priority types\n|-\n| 2 || Inline || A style applied to an HTML element via HTML \"style\" attribute\n|-\n| 3 || Media Type || A property definition applies to all media types, unless a media specific CSS is defined\n|-\n| 4 || User defined || Most browsers have the accessibility feature: a user defined CSS\n|-\n| 5 || Selector specificity || A specific contextual selector ({{code|lang=css|code=#heading p}}) overwrites generic definition\n|-\n| 6 || Rule order || Last rule declaration has a higher priority\n|-\n| 7 || Parent inheritance || If a property is not specified, it is inherited from a parent element\n|-\n| 8 || CSS property definition in HTML document || CSS rule or CSS inline style overwrites a default browser value\n|-\n| 9 || Browser default || The lowest priority: browser default value is determined by W3C initial value specifications\n|}\n\n===Specificity===\n''Specificity'' refers to the relative weights of various rules.<ref name=\"Cascading\">{{Cite book | edition = 3rd | publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc. | isbn = 0-596-52733-0 | last = Meyer | first = Eric A. | title = Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide | url = http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565926226.do | year = 2006 | access-date = 2014-02-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140215041138/http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565926226.do | archive-date = 2014-02-15 | url-status = live }}</ref> It determines which styles apply to an element when more than one rule could apply.  Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has a specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID selectors a specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to separate the \"digits\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity|title=Assigning property values, Cascading, and Inheritance|publisher=|access-date=2014-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611010536/http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity|archive-date=2014-06-11|url-status=live}}</ref> (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have a specificity of 11,11, not 121).\n\nThus the following rules selectors result in the indicated specificity:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Selectors !! Specificity\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>H1 {color: white;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 0, 1\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>P EM {color: green;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 0, 2\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>.grape {color: red;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 1, 0\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>P.bright {color: blue;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 1, 1\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>P.bright EM.dark {color: yellow;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 0, 2, 2\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>#id218 {color: brown;}</syntaxhighlight> || 0, 1, 0, 0\n|-\n| <syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\" inline>style=\" \"</syntaxhighlight> || 1, 0, 0, 0\n|}\n\n====Examples====\n\nConsider this HTML fragment:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"HTML5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <style>\n    #xyz { color: blue; }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p id=\"xyz\" style=\"color: green;\"> To demonstrate specificity </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIn the above example, the declaration in the <code>style</code> attribute overrides the one in the <code><style></code> element because it has a higher specificity, and thus, the paragraph appears green.\n\n===Inheritance===\nInheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.<ref name=\"Cascading\"/> Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of [[XHTML]] elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them.\nIn general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but their box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.\n\nInheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and over again in a style sheet, allowing for shorter CSS.\n\nInheritance in CSS is not the same as [[Class-based programming#Inheritance|inheritance in class-based programming languages]], where it is possible to define class B as \"like class A, but with modifications\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Can a CSS class inherit one or more other classes?|url = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1065435/can-a-css-class-inherit-one-or-more-other-classes|website = StackOverflow|accessdate = 2017-09-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171014054727/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1065435/can-a-css-class-inherit-one-or-more-other-classes|archive-date = 2017-10-14|url-status = live}}</ref> With CSS, it is possible to style an ''element'' with \"class A, but with modifications\". However, it is not possible to define a CSS ''class'' B like that, which could then be used to style multiple elements without having to repeat the modifications.\n\n====Example====\nGiven the following style sheet:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\">\nh1 {\n   color: pink;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nSuppose there is an h1 element with an emphasizing element (em) inside:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<h1>\n   This is to <em>illustrate</em> inheritance\n</h1>\n</syntaxhighlight>\nIf no color is assigned to the em element, the emphasized word \"illustrate\" inherits the color of the parent element, h1. The style sheet h1 has the color pink, hence, the em element is likewise pink.\n\n===Whitespace===\n\nWhitespace between properties and selectors is ignored. This code snippet:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">\nbody{overflow:hidden;background:#000000;background-image:url(images/bg.gif);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:left top;}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nis functionally equivalent to this one:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">\nbody {\n   overflow: hidden;\n   background-color: #000000;\n   background-image: url(images/bg.gif);\n   background-repeat: no-repeat;\n   background-position: left top;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nOne common way to format CSS for readability is to indent each property and give it its own line. In addition to formatting CSS for readability, shorthand properties can be used to write out the code faster, which also gets processed more quickly when being rendered:<ref name=\"Mozilla Developers\">{{cite news |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties |title=Shorthand properties |work=Tutorial |publisher=Mozilla Developers |date=2017-12-07 |access-date=2018-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130204516/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties |archive-date=2018-01-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">\nbody {\n   overflow: hidden;\n   background: #000 url(images/bg.gif) no-repeat left top;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Positioning===\nCSS&nbsp;2.1 defines three positioning schemes:\n;Normal flow: ''Inline'' items are laid out in the same way as the letters in words in text, one after the other across the available space until there is no more room, then starting a new line below. ''Block'' items stack vertically, like paragraphs and like the items in a bulleted list. Normal flow also includes relative positioning of block or inline items, and run-in boxes.\n;Floats: A floated item is taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible in the space available. Other content then flows alongside the floated item.\n;Absolute positioning: An absolutely positioned item has no place in, and no effect on, the normal flow of other items. It occupies its assigned position in its container independently of other items.<ref name=\"W3C-positioning\">{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Bert|title=9.3 Positioning schemes|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#positioning-scheme|work=Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification|publisher=W3C|accessdate=16 February 2011|date=7 December 2010|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218054848/http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#positioning-scheme|archive-date=18 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Position property====\nThere are four possible values of the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\" inline>position</syntaxhighlight> property.

Subsequent flow items are laid out as if the item had not been moved.\n;Absolute: Specifies ''absolute positioning''.

It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by [[Steven Pemberton]]. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including [[Thomas Reardon]] of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996, [[Netscape|Netscape Communication Corporation]] presented an alternative style sheet language called [[JavaScript Style Sheets]] (JSSS).<ref name=\"chapter20\" /> The spec was never finished, and is deprecated.<ref>{{cite web|title=JavaScript-Based Style Sheets|url=http://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822|publisher=W3C|accessdate=23 June 2010|author=[[Lou Montulli]]|author2=[[Brendan Eich]]|author3=[[Scott Furman]]|author4=[[Donna Converse]]|author5=[[Troy Chevalier]]|date=22 August 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527213412/http://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822|archive-date=27 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.\n\nDevelopment of HTML, CSS, and the [[Document Object Model|DOM]] had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: [[HTML Working group]], chaired by [[Dan Connolly (computer scientist)|Dan Connolly]] of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of [[SoftQuad]]; and [[CSS Working group]], chaired by [[Chris Lilley (W3C)|Chris Lilley]] of W3C.\n\nThe CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.\n\nIn 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant that already published standards like CSS&nbsp;2.1, CSS&nbsp;3 Selectors, and CSS&nbsp;3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.\n\n===Difficulty with adoption===\n{{Outdated|date=January 2019}}\nThe CSS&nbsp;1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer 3]]<ref name=\"chapter20\" /> was released in that year, featuring some limited support for CSS.  [[Internet Explorer 4|IE 4]] and [[Netscape Navigator|Netscape 4.x]] added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had many [[Software bug|bugs]] that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification. [[Internet Explorer for Mac|Internet Explorer 5.0]] for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], shipped in March 2000, was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS&nbsp;1 support,<ref>{{cite web|title=CSS software|publisher=W3.org|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/software.en.html#w26|accessdate=2011-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125162013/http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/software.en.html#w26|archive-date=2010-11-25|url-status=live}}</ref> surpassing [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterwards, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS&nbsp;2.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHowever, even when later 'version 5' web browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain areas and were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs and other [[Quirks mode|quirks]]. [[Internet Explorer 5|Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x for Windows]], as opposed to the very different [[Internet Explorer for Mac|IE for Macintosh]], had a flawed implementation of the '[[CSS box model]]', as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across browsers and [[Computing platform|platform]]s without the use of [[workaround]]s termed [[CSS hack|CSS hacks and filters]]. The IE/Windows box model bugs were so serious that, when [[Internet Explorer 6]] was released, Microsoft introduced a backwards-compatible mode of CSS interpretation ('[[quirks mode]]') alongside an alternative, corrected 'standards mode'. Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided such 'mode'-switch behavior capability. It therefore became necessary for authors of [[HTML]] files to ensure they contained special distinctive [[Document type declaration#HTML5 DTD-less DOCTYPE|'standards-compliant CSS intended' marker]] to show that the authors intended CSS to be interpreted correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now long-obsolete [[Internet Explorer 5|IE5/Windows browser]]. Without this marker, web browsers that have the 'quirks mode'-switching capability will size objects in web pages as IE5/Windows would rather than following CSS standards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nProblems with patchy adoption of CSS, along with errata in the original specification, led the W3C to revise the CSS&nbsp;2 standard into CSS&nbsp;2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS&nbsp;2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations. CSS&nbsp;2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS&nbsp;2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/06/css-21|title=CSS 2.1&nbsp;\u2013 Anne's Weblog|author=[[Anne van Kesteren]]|accessdate=2011-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210101312/http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/06/css-21|archive-date=2005-12-10|url-status=live}}</ref> and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status on July 19, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/News/2007.html#entry-7058|title=Archive of W3C News in 2007|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=2011-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628191558/http://www.w3.org/News/2007.html#entry-7058|archive-date=2011-06-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these problems, the <code>.css</code> extension was used by a software product used to convert [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] files into Compact Slide Show files,<ref>{{cite web|last=Nitot |first=Tristan |title=Incorrect MIME Type for CSS Files |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Incorrect_MIME_Type_for_CSS_Files |work=[[Mozilla Developer Center]] |publisher=[[Mozilla]] |accessdate=20 June 2010 |date=18 March 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520044919/https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Incorrect_MIME_Type_for_CSS_Files |archive-date=2011-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nso some web servers served all <code>.css</code><ref>{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Don|title=File Types|url=http://donsnotes.com/tech/filetype.html|accessdate=20 June 2010|date=27 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029155135/http://donsnotes.com/tech/filetype.html|archive-date=29 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> as [[Internet media type|MIME type]] <code>application/x-pointplus</code><ref>{{cite web|title=css file extension details|url=http://extensions.pndesign.cz/css-file|publisher=File extension database|accessdate=20 June 2010|date=12 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718182554/http://extensions.pndesign.cz/css-file|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> rather than <code>text/css</code>.\n\n===Variations===\nCSS has various levels and profiles.

Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known as [[CSS hacks]] or CSS filters). Adoption of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/css3-solutions-for-internet-explorer/|title=CSS3 Solutions for Internet Explorer \u2013 Smashing Magazine|date=2010-04-28|newspaper=Smashing Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012224430/https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/css3-solutions-for-internet-explorer/|archive-date=2016-10-12|url-status=live}}</ref> In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing development time and complexity. Tools such as [[BrowserStack]] have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments.\n\nIn addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of browser support for specific CSS properties, including [http://caniuse.com/ CanIUse] and the [[Mozilla Developer Network]]. Additionally, the CSS 3 defines feature queries, which provide an <code>@supports</code> directive that will allow developers to target browsers with support for certain functionality directly within their CSS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/|title=Using Feature Queries in CSS \u2605         Mozilla Hacks \u2013 the Web developer blog|website=hacks.mozilla.org|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011151259/https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/|archive-date=2016-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref> CSS that is not supported by older browsers can also sometimes be patched in using JavaScript [[Polyfill (programming)|polyfill]]s, which are pieces of JavaScript code designed to make browsers behave consistently. These workarounds\u2014and the need to support fallback functionality\u2014can add complexity to development projects, and consequently, companies frequently define a list of browser versions that they will and will not support.\n\nAs websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/looking-at-the-web-with-internet-explorer-6-one-last-time/|title=Looking at the Web with Internet Explorer 6, one last time|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012151514/http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/looking-at-the-web-with-internet-explorer-6-one-last-time/|archive-date=2016-10-12|url-status=live}}</ref> Many of the most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded on older browsers due to poor CSS support, but do not work at all, in large part due to the evolution of JavaScript and other web technologies.\n\n==Limitations==\nSome noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:\n\n; Selectors are unable to ascend: CSS currently offers no way to select a ''parent'' or ''ancestor'' of an element that satisfies certain criteria.<ref name=\"css-missing\">{{cite web |url=http://www.creativebloq.com/css3/seven-things-still-missing-css-1126553 |author=[[Molly Holzschlag]] |title=Seven Things Still Missing from CSS |publisher=.net Magazine |date=January 2012 |access-date=2017-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305034521/http://www.creativebloq.com/css3/seven-things-still-missing-css-1126553 |archive-date=2017-03-05 |url-status=live }}</ref><!--{{clarify|what criteria exactly?|date=November 2011}}--> CSS Selectors Level 4, which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a selector,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#subject |title=Selectors Level 4 \u2013 Determining the Subject of a Selector |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2013-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817120016/http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#subject |archive-date=2013-08-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> but only as part of the \"complete\" selector profile, not the \"fast\" profile used in dynamic CSS styling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#profiles |title=Selectors Level 4 \u2013 Fast vs Complete Selector Profiles |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2013-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817120016/http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#profiles |archive-date=2013-08-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> A more advanced selector scheme (such as [[XPath]]) would enable more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for the CSS Working Group previously rejecting proposals for parent selectors are related to browser performance and [[incremental rendering]] issues.<ref name=\"why-not-parent-selector\">{{cite web |url=http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-parent-selectors |first=Jonathan |last=Snook |title=Why we don't have a parent selector |publisher=snook.ca |date=October 2010 |access-date=2012-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118135154/http://www.snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-parent-selectors |archive-date=2012-01-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n; Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position: Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent element with a position:absolute or position:relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is forced to adjust an element's position, preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element.\n; Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable: CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class, \"{{code|lang=css|code=:hover}}\", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript \"onmouseover\") and has potential for abuse (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html |title=Pure CSS Popups |publisher=meyerweb.com |accessdate=2009-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209071014/http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html |archive-date=2009-12-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no \"disable\"-like property) or limit its effects (no \"nochange\"-like values for each property).\n; Cannot name rules: There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes.\n; Cannot include styles from a rule into another rule: CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules to achieve a desired effect, causing additional maintenance and requiring more thorough testing. Some new CSS features were proposed to solve this, but (as of February, 2016) are not yet implemented anywhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-apply-rule/|author=Tab Atkins Jr.|title=CSS apply rule|publisher=GitHub|accessdate=2016-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222160949/http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-apply-rule/|archive-date=2016-02-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\n; Cannot target specific text without altering markup: Besides the {{code|lang=css|code=:first-letter}} pseudo-element, one cannot target specific ranges of text without needing to utilize place-holder elements.\n\n===Former issues===\nAdditionally, several more issues were present in prior versions of the CSS standard, but have been alleviated:\n; Vertical control limitations: Though horizontal placement of elements was always generally easy to control, vertical placement was frequently unintuitive, convoluted, or outright impossible.

With CSS&nbsp;2.1, the process is often done using floating elements, which are often rendered differently by different browsers, different computer screen shapes, and different screen ratios set on standard monitors. All of the modern browsers support this CSS 3 feature in one form or another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caniuse.com/columns|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100821011307/https://caniuse.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-08-21|title=Can I use...

Nominal parameters include explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of device being used to view the content (a desktop computer or mobile device), the geographic location of the user and many other variables.\n;Site-wide consistency: {{Main article|Style sheet (web development)}} \n:When CSS is used effectively, in terms of inheritance and \"cascading\", a global style sheet can be used to affect and style elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the styling of the elements should be changed or adjusted, these changes can be made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS, this sort of maintenance was more difficult, expensive and time-consuming.\n;Bandwidth: A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a range of HTML elements selected by <code>class</code>, type or relationship to others. This is much more efficient than repeating style information inline for each occurrence of the element. An external stylesheet is usually stored in the [[browser cache]], and can therefore be used on multiple pages without being reloaded, further reducing data transfer over a network.\n;Page reformatting: {{Main article|Progressive enhancement}}\n:With a simple change of one line, a different style sheet can be used for the same page. This has advantages for accessibility, as well as providing the ability to tailor a page or site to different target devices. Furthermore, devices not able to understand the styling still display the content.\n;Accessibility: Without CSS, web designers must typically lay out their pages with techniques such as HTML tables that hinder accessibility for vision-impaired users (see [[Tableless web design#Accessibility]]).\n\n==Standardization==\n===Frameworks===\n{{Main article|CSS framework}}\n[[CSS framework]]s are pre-prepared [[Library (computing)|libraries]] that are meant to allow for easier, more [[standards-compliant]] styling of [[web page]]s using the Cascading Style Sheets language. CSS frameworks include [[Foundation (framework)|Foundation]], [[Blueprint (CSS framework)|Blueprint]], [[Bootstrap (framework)|Bootstrap]], [[Cascade Framework]] and Materialize. Like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks are usually incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML {{code|lang=html|code=<head>}}. They provide a number of ready-made options for designing and laying out the web page. Although many of these frameworks have been published, some authors use them mostly for rapid prototyping, or for learning from, and prefer to 'handcraft' CSS that is appropriate to each published site without the design, maintenance and download overhead of having many unused features in the site's styling.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cederholm|first=Dan|title=Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design|year=2009|publisher=New Riders|isbn=978-0-321-64338-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgrUeIwsS60C&pg=PA114|author2=Ethan Marcotte|accessdate=19 June 2010|page=114|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220221903/http://books.google.com/books?id=UgrUeIwsS60C&pg=PA114|archive-date=20 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Design methodologies===\nAs the size of CSS resources used in a project increases, a development team often needs to decide on a common design methodology to keep them organized.

He led on tax reform, [[civil rights]], and financial transparency for public officials, maintaining an outstanding reputation for personal integrity.<ref name=\"top50\"/>\n\nBorn in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], Askew established a legal practice in [[Pensacola, Florida]], after graduating from the [[Fredric G.

He defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governor [[Claude R.

He was one of the first of the \"[[New South]]\" governors and supported school [[desegregation]].

His signature used the double initial (O'D.) in her honor.<ref name=FT />\n\nIn 1944, Askew was initiated as a member of Escambia Chapter [[Order of DeMolay]], an organization of young men based on the [[Knights Templar]]. He graduated from [[Pensacola High School]] in 1946. Later that year, Askew entered the Army as a [[paratrooper]], serving for two years; in 1948 he was discharged in the rank of [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]].\n\nAskew next attended [[Florida State University]], where he was a brother of [[Delta Tau Delta]] and [[Alpha Phi Omega]]. At FSU, Askew was elected as student body president, beginning his long career in politics.

In 1958, he was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]], representing Escambia County. After serving two terms in the House, in 1962 Askew was elected to the [[Florida Senate]] from the 2nd district, also representing Escambia.

In 1971 he received the Legion of Honor from the International Supreme Council of the Order of DeMolay.\n\nAskew emerged as a progressive lawmaker: he supported reapportionment in the state legislature in order to recognize changes in population distribution and increase representation for urban counties, which had a higher population than rural ones. The state houses had been apportioned by geographic county, resulting in inequities that did not represent current state conditions. Urban areas were underrepresented in the legislature. As was typical of many states, rural legislators had resisted reapportionment in order to retain power.<ref name=\"top50\">[https://archive.is/20030915152226/http://www.theledger.com/static/top50/pages/askew.html http://www.theledger.com/static/top50/pages/askew.html Lloyd Dunkelberger, \"Top 50 Floridians of the 20th Century: Reubin Askew\"], ''The Ledger''</ref>\n\nAskew had opposed legal [[racial segregation]] and the continuing disenfranchisement of black voters. They had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchised]] since the turn of the century, when Florida had passed a new constitution with provisions for voter registration and elections that effectively blocked blacks from the polls. Passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] authorized the federal government to exercise oversight over jurisdictions in which classes of voters were historically underrepresented in voter rolls and voting patterns; African Americans were helped to re-enter the political system.\n\n==Governorship==\nAskew won the Democratic nomination for governor in 1970. State Secretary of Florida [[Thomas Burton Adams, Jr.]], was his running-mate for lieutenant governor. In its endorsement of\nAskew-Adams, the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' said that Askew had \"captured the imagination of a state that plainly deserves new leadership.\" During the campaign, the incumbent Republican governor, [[Claude R. Kirk, Jr.]], ridiculed his opponent Askew as \"a momma's boy who wouldn't have the courage to stand up under the fire of the legislators\" and a \"nice sweet-looking fellow chosen by liberals ... to front for them.\"<ref>''[[Miami Herald]]'' and ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'', October 30, 1970</ref> Such rhetoric helped to reinvigorate the Democratic coalition. Mike Thompson, who managed the 1970 Republican gubernatorial primary campaign waged by state representative [[Louis A. Bafalis|L. A. \"Skip\" Bafalis]], sat out the general election between Kirk and Askew. Thompson later said that the often acerbic Kirk had demolished \"the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats who elected him in 1966. ... The trail from [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] to [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] is littered with the bodies of former friends, supporters, and citizens -- all of whom made the fatal mistake of believing the words of Claude Kirk.\"<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Cramer v. Kirk: The Florida Republican Schism of 1970,\" ''Florida Historical Quarterly'' (April 1990), p. 416</ref>\n\nBy the margin of 57-43 percent, Askew and Adams unseated Kirk and his running-mate, Lieutenant Governor [[Ray C. Osborne]]. (From 1887 to 1969, the Florida Constitution did not provide for a lieutenant governor. The change allowed the top two positions to be filled by running mates from the same political party)\n\nIn 1974, Askew was re-elected, with [[Jim Williams (Florida)|J. H. Williams]] as his running mate. He is one of just five Florida governors to have been elected for two terms (the others were [[LeRoy Collins]], [[Bob Graham]], [[Lawton Chiles]], [[Jeb Bush]], and [[Rick Scott]]). Askew was the first governor to serve two full four-year terms.\n\nThrough his two terms, Askew worked on tax reform. In 1971 he gained passage of the state's first corporate income tax.<ref name=\"top50\"/> He also gained an increase in the homestead exemption.\n\nIn every political role, Askew argued for transparency in government. He tried three times to get the legislature to pass a bill requiring financial disclosure by public officials. When they did not, he used a provision of the 1968 constitution, collecting sufficient signatures to put the measure on the ballot in 1976.<ref name=\"fsne.org\"/> The voters passed the \"Sunshine Amendment\" by 78%, the first time the constitution was amended due to citizen action. It calls for full financial disclosure by public officials and candidates, a ban on gifts to legislators, and prohibits former officials from lobbying for two years after leaving office.<ref name=\"fsne.org\"/>\n\nAt a time of government scandals, he established a reputation for personal integrity and was known as \"Reubin the Good.\" Government scandals erupted around him, but he was called \"Reubin the Good\" because of his personal integrity. According to a political foe, \"He has established a kind of morality in office that causes people to have faith\" in government.<ref name=\"top50\"/>\n\nIn addition to dealing with state issues, Askew pursued collaboration with other governors: he chaired the Education Commission of the States (1973-1974), the Southern Governors' Conference (1974-1975), and the Democratic Governors' Conference (1976-1977).<ref name=\"nga\"/> Governor Askew was chairman of the National Governors' Conference in 1977.<ref name=\"nga\"/>\n\n===Civil rights issues and the New South===\nAskew was one of the first of the \"[[New South]]\" governors, elected in the same year as governors [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia, [[Dale Bumpers]] of Arkansas (who defeated [[Orval Faubus]]), and [[John C. West]] of South Carolina. They were later joined by [[Bill Clinton]] of Arkansas. He supported school [[desegregation]] and the controversial idea of busing to achieve racial balance (mandatory [[racial integration|integration]]).\n\nHe expressed a progressive model in his appointments, naming the first black Justice of the State Supreme Court, [[Joseph Woodrow Hatchett]].<ref name=FT /> He appointed [[M. Athalie Range]] as Secretary of the Department of Community Affairs; she was the first black person appointed to state government since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the first woman to head a state agency in Florida.  In 1978 Askew appointed [[Jesse J. McCrary Jr.]] as secretary of state; he was the first black person to hold a cabinet-level office in Florida in the modern era.\n\n===Capital punishment===\nAfter the 1972 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]''  effectively overturned existing state laws for [[capital punishment in the United States]], Florida was the first state to enact a new death penalty statute,<ref>[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state Death Penalty Information Center website]</ref> which Governor Askew signed. But, Askew personally believed that the death penalty was appropriate only in rare cases.<ref>[http://www.floridacapitalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080703/COLUMNIST03/807030309 Askew's view on capital punishment], ''Florida Capital News,'' 3 July 2008</ref> Afterward the Supreme Court accepted new state death-penalty laws in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]''.

For the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], he was offered the vice presidential slot on the Democratic ticket with presidential nominee [[George McGovern]], but he turned it down.

In 1979, he accepted President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s invitation to be the [[United States Trade Representative]] and served until Carter's term ended in January 1981.

The first serious presidential candidate from Florida, Askew never gained traction within the national Democratic party.  Although progressive on civil rights, Askew was notably more conservative than most of the other candidates. He was anti-abortion, but failed to win Catholic voters in Iowa; against the nuclear freeze, against the right of gays to work as teachers; and for President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s invasion of [[Grenada]] in October 1983. Askew withdrew on March 1, 1984, after he finished last in the [[New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire Democratic Primary]].\n\nIn 1987, he declared his candidacy for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

The state houses had been apportioned by geographic county, resulting in inequities that did not represent current state conditions. Urban areas were underrepresented in the legislature.

They had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchised]] since the turn of the century, when Florida had passed a new constitution with provisions for voter registration and elections that effectively blocked blacks from the polls. Passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] authorized the federal government to exercise oversight over jurisdictions in which classes of voters were historically underrepresented in voter rolls and voting patterns; African Americans were helped to re-enter the political system.\n\n==Governorship==\nAskew won the Democratic nomination for governor in 1970. State Secretary of Florida [[Thomas Burton Adams, Jr.]], was his running-mate for lieutenant governor. In its endorsement of\nAskew-Adams, the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' said that Askew had \"captured the imagination of a state that plainly deserves new leadership.\" During the campaign, the incumbent Republican governor, [[Claude R.

Mike Thompson, who managed the 1970 Republican gubernatorial primary campaign waged by state representative [[Louis A. Bafalis|L.

Thompson later said that the often acerbic Kirk had demolished \"the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats who elected him in 1966. ... The trail from [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] to [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] is littered with the bodies of former friends, supporters, and citizens -- all of whom made the fatal mistake of believing the words of Claude Kirk.\"<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Cramer v. Kirk: The Florida Republican Schism of 1970,\" ''Florida Historical Quarterly'' (April 1990), p. 416</ref>\n\nBy the margin of 57-43 percent, Askew and Adams unseated Kirk and his running-mate, Lieutenant Governor [[Ray C. Osborne]]. (From 1887 to 1969, the Florida Constitution did not provide for a lieutenant governor. The change allowed the top two positions to be filled by running mates from the same political party)\n\nIn 1974, Askew was re-elected, with [[Jim Williams (Florida)|J. H. Williams]] as his running mate. He is one of just five Florida governors to have been elected for two terms (the others were [[LeRoy Collins]], [[Bob Graham]], [[Lawton Chiles]], [[Jeb Bush]], and [[Rick Scott]]). Askew was the first governor to serve two full four-year terms.\n\nThrough his two terms, Askew worked on tax reform. In 1971 he gained passage of the state's first corporate income tax.<ref name=\"top50\"/> He also gained an increase in the homestead exemption.\n\nIn every political role, Askew argued for transparency in government. He tried three times to get the legislature to pass a bill requiring financial disclosure by public officials. When they did not, he used a provision of the 1968 constitution, collecting sufficient signatures to put the measure on the ballot in 1976.<ref name=\"fsne.org\"/> The voters passed the \"Sunshine Amendment\" by 78%, the first time the constitution was amended due to citizen action. It calls for full financial disclosure by public officials and candidates, a ban on gifts to legislators, and prohibits former officials from lobbying for two years after leaving office.<ref name=\"fsne.org\"/>\n\nAt a time of government scandals, he established a reputation for personal integrity and was known as \"Reubin the Good.\" Government scandals erupted around him, but he was called \"Reubin the Good\" because of his personal integrity. According to a political foe, \"He has established a kind of morality in office that causes people to have faith\" in government.<ref name=\"top50\"/>\n\nIn addition to dealing with state issues, Askew pursued collaboration with other governors: he chaired the Education Commission of the States (1973-1974), the Southern Governors' Conference (1974-1975), and the Democratic Governors' Conference (1976-1977).<ref name=\"nga\"/> Governor Askew was chairman of the National Governors' Conference in 1977.<ref name=\"nga\"/>\n\n===Civil rights issues and the New South===\nAskew was one of the first of the \"[[New South]]\" governors, elected in the same year as governors [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia, [[Dale Bumpers]] of Arkansas (who defeated [[Orval Faubus]]), and [[John C. West]] of South Carolina. They were later joined by [[Bill Clinton]] of Arkansas. He supported school [[desegregation]] and the controversial idea of busing to achieve racial balance (mandatory [[racial integration|integration]]).\n\nHe expressed a progressive model in his appointments, naming the first black Justice of the State Supreme Court, [[Joseph Woodrow Hatchett]].<ref name=FT /> He appointed [[M. Athalie Range]] as Secretary of the Department of Community Affairs; she was the first black person appointed to state government since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the first woman to head a state agency in Florida.  In 1978 Askew appointed [[Jesse J. McCrary Jr.]] as secretary of state; he was the first black person to hold a cabinet-level office in Florida in the modern era.\n\n===Capital punishment===\nAfter the 1972 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]''  effectively overturned existing state laws for [[capital punishment in the United States]], Florida was the first state to enact a new death penalty statute,<ref>[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state Death Penalty Information Center website]</ref> which Governor Askew signed. But, Askew personally believed that the death penalty was appropriate only in rare cases.<ref>[http://www.floridacapitalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080703/COLUMNIST03/807030309 Askew's view on capital punishment], ''Florida Capital News,'' 3 July 2008</ref> Afterward the Supreme Court accepted new state death-penalty laws in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]''. Immediately after the ruling, which effectively reinstated the use of the death penalty in the United States, Governor Askew began signing death warrants.<ref>Craig Brandon, ''The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History'', McFarland, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7864-0686-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-0686-9}}</ref> Executions were not resumed until the administration of his successor, [[Bob Graham]].\n\nBased on issues related to the cases of two life-sentenced inmates, [[Pitts and Lee v. Florida|Wilbert Lee and Freddie Pitts]], Askew ordered a new investigation. It found they had been wrongfully convicted of murder in 1963. Askew participated in part of the inquiry and in 1975 [[pardon]]ed both inmates, who had been removed from death row after the Supreme Court's decision halting capital punishment.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913486,00.html \"Law: Twelve Years to Justice\"], ''Time'' magazine, 29 September 1975</ref>\n\n===Presidential politics===\nAskew's national stature in the Democratic party grew, and in 1972, he was the keynote speaker at the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Miami]]. For the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], he was offered the vice presidential slot on the Democratic ticket with presidential nominee [[George McGovern]], but he turned it down. He later accepted an appointment under President [[Jimmy Carter]] as chairman of the Advisory Committee on Ambassadorial Appointments.\n\n==Later career==\n[[Image:ReubinAskew.JPG|thumb|upright|Askew in 1983.]]\n\n===Trade Representative===\nLimited to two terms as governor by the Florida constitution, Askew looked for his next opportunity. In 1979, he accepted President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s invitation to be the [[United States Trade Representative]] and served until Carter's term ended in January 1981. Askew was the first trade representative who held the title ''United States Trade Representative'', not ''Special Trade Representative'', as his predecessors were called.<ref>[http://www.ustr.gov/Who_We_Are/United_States_Trade_Representatives,_1962_-_Present.html?ht= USTR - United States Trade Representatives, 1962 - Present<!--Bot-generated title-->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185628/http://www.ustr.gov/Who_We_Are/United_States_Trade_Representatives,_1962_-_Present.html?ht=|date=30 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Presidential bid in 1984 and Senatorial bid in 1988===\nAskew joined a Miami law firm and at the same time began to organize a Presidential bid for the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]]. He announced his candidacy on February 23, 1983 after making visits to all 50 states. The first serious presidential candidate from Florida, Askew never gained traction within the national Democratic party.  Although progressive on civil rights, Askew was notably more conservative than most of the other candidates. He was anti-abortion, but failed to win Catholic voters in Iowa; against the nuclear freeze, against the right of gays to work as teachers; and for President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s invasion of [[Grenada]] in October 1983. Askew withdrew on March 1, 1984, after he finished last in the [[New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire Democratic Primary]].\n\nIn 1987, he declared his candidacy for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. But in May 1988, he withdrew from the contest, citing the need for perpetual fundraising.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunkelberger|first1=Lloyd|title=Former Gov.

They had started switching parties beginning in the mid-1960s.\n\n===In retirement===\nIn 1994, former governor Askew was named to the founding class of the Florida DeMolay Hall of Fame.\n\nThe '''[[Askew School of Public Administration and Policy|Reubin O'D. Askew School of Public Administration and Policy]]''' at [[Florida State University]] was named for him. It offers courses in government at several Florida universities. From 1999 until his death, Askew gave a graduate seminar at the school, on topics of state and local government as well as international trade.<ref name=\"fsne.org\"/>\n\nFor the ten years prior to that, Askew lectured and taught at each of the other ten public universities in the state.<ref name=\"fsne.org\"/> In 1994, the '''[[Askew Institute on Politics and Society|Reubin O'D Askew Institute on Politics and Society]]'''  at the [[University of Florida]] was established to provide a center for bringing together people to work on state issues. Askew also lectured and participated in conferences there.\n\n==Personal life==\nAskew married Donna Lou Harper in August 1956.<ref name=FT /> He proposed to her two weeks after the first date, and they married five months after. By all accounts, the two enjoyed a very happy marriage, and unlike his father, Askew remained faithful to her.<ref name=\"Harvey\"/> They had two adopted children; a daughter and a son.<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/075/000116724/]</ref> Throughout his life, Askew refrained from smoking, drinking, swearing, and gambling.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NpoCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA182&dq=reubin+askew&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkpYCws5HdAhWBCnwKHcdEC0EQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=donna&f=false|title=The Politics of Trust: Reubin Askew and Florida in the 1970s|last=Harvey|first=Gordon E.|date=November 2015|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817318826}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nAskew died at the age of 85 on March 13, 2014, from complications of a stroke.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/us/politics/reubin-askew-former-florida-governor-dies-at-85.html|title = Reubin Askew, a Progressive Governor of Florida in the \u201970s, Dies at 85|work = [[The New York Times]]|last = McFadden|first = Robert D.|authorlink = Robert D.
