Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the [[smelting]] of other metals, e.g. [[iron]], because in contrast, zinc has a low [[boiling point]].

The chemical reactions that take place are as follows:\n\n:<chem>2ZnS + 3O2 -> 2ZnO + 2SO2</chem>\n\n:<chem>2SO2 + O2 -> 2SO3</chem>\n\nApproximately 90% of zinc in concentrates are oxidized to zinc oxide. However, at the roasting temperatures around 10% of the zinc reacts with the iron impurities of the zinc sulfide concentrates to form [[zinc ferrite]]. A byproduct of roasting is [[sulfur dioxide]], which is further processed into [[sulfuric acid]], a [[commodity]].<ref name=nyrstar/> The linked refinery flow sheet shows a schematic of Noranda's eastern Canadian zinc roasting operation<ref>Noranda's zinc roasting operation illustrated http://www.norandaincomefund.com/pdfs/refinery_flowsheet.pdf</ref>\n\nThe process of roasting varies based on the type of roaster used. There are three types of roasters: multiple-hearth, suspension, and fluidized-bed.<ref name=epa/>\n\n===Multiple-hearth roaster===\nIn a multiple-hearth roaster, the concentrate drops through a series of 9 or more hearths stacked inside a brick-lined cylindrical column. As the feed concentrate drops through the furnace, it is first dried by the hot gases passing through the hearths and then oxidized to produce calcine. The reactions are slow and can be sustained only by the addition of fuel. Multiple hearth roasters are unpressurized and operate at about {{convert|690|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|-1|abbr=on}}. Operating time depends upon the composition of concentrate and the amount of the sulfur removal required. Multiple hearth roasters have the capability of producing a high-purity calcine.<ref name=epa/>\n\n===Suspension roaster===\nIn a suspension roaster, the concentrates are blown into a combustion chamber very similar to that of a pulverized coal furnace. The roaster consists of a refractory-lined cylindrical steel shell, with a large combustion space at the top and 2 to 4 hearths in the lower portion, similar to those of a multiple hearth furnace. Additional grinding, beyond that required for a multiple hearth furnace, is normally required to ensure that heat transfer to the material is sufficiently rapid for the desulfurization and oxidation reactions to occur in the furnace chamber. Suspension roasters are unpressurized and operate at about {{convert|980|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=epa/>\n\n===Fluidized-bed roaster===\nIn a fluidized-bed roaster, finely ground sulfide concentrates are suspended and oxidized in a feedstock bed supported on an air column. As in the suspension roaster, the reaction rates for desulfurization are more rapid than in the older multiple-hearth processes. Fluidized-bed roasters operate under a pressure slightly lower than atmospheric and at temperatures averaging {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. In the fluidized-bed process, no additional fuel is required after ignition has been achieved. The major advantages of this roaster are greater throughput capacities, greater sulfur removal capabilities, and lower maintenance.<ref name=epa/>\n\n==Electrolysis process==\nThe electrolysis process, also known as the hydrometallurgical process, Roast-Leach-Electrowin (RLE) process, or electrolytic process, is more widely used than the pyrometallurgical processes.<ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nThe electrolysis process consists of 4 steps: leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting and casting.\n\n===Leaching===\n{{main|Leaching (metallurgy)}}\n\nThe basic leaching chemical formula that drives this process is:\n\n:<chem>ZnO + SO3 -> ZnSO4</chem>\n\nThis is achieved in practice through a process called double leaching. The calcine is first leached in a neutral or slightly acidic solution (of sulfuric acid) in order to leach the zinc out of the zinc oxide. The remaining calcine is then leached in strong sulfuric acid to leach the rest of the zinc out of the zinc oxide and zinc ferrite. The result of this process is a solid and a liquid; the liquid contains the zinc and is often called leach product; the solid is called leach residue and contains precious metals (usually lead and silver) which are sold as a by-product. There is also iron in the leach product from the strong acid leach, which is removed in an intermediate step, in the form of [[goethite]], [[jarosite]], and [[haematite]]. There is still [[cadmium]], [[copper]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[cobalt]], [[germanium]], [[nickel]], and [[thallium]] in the leach product. Therefore, it needs to be purified.<ref name=epa/><ref name=nyrstar/>\n\n===Purification===\n{{main|Cementation (metallurgy)}}\n\nThe purification process utilizes the cementation process to further purify the zinc. It uses zinc dust and steam to remove copper, cadmium, cobalt, and nickel, which would interfere with the electrolysis process. After purification, concentrations of these impurities are limited to less than 0.05 milligram per liter (4\u00d710<sup>\u22127</sup> pound per U.S. gallon). Purification is usually conducted in large agitated tanks. The process takes place at temperatures ranging from {{convert|40|to|85|C|F}}, and pressures ranging from atmospheric to {{convert|2.4|atm|kPa|-1|abbr=on}} (absolute scale). The by-products are sold for further refining.<ref name=epa/><ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nThe zinc sulfate solution must be very pure for electrowinning to be at all efficient. Impurities can change the decomposition voltage enough to where the electrolysis cell produces largely hydrogen gas rather than zinc metal.<ref name=\"samans\">{{Citation |title=Engineering Metals and their Alloys |last=Samans |first=Carl H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1949 |publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |isbn= |pages= | postscript =.}}</ref>\n\n===Electrolysis===\n{{main|Electrowinning}}\n\nZinc is extracted from the purified zinc sulfate solution by [[electrowinning]], which is a specialized form of electrolysis. The process works by passing an electric current through the solution in a series of cells. This causes the zinc to deposit on the cathodes ([[aluminium]] sheets) and oxygen to form at the anodes. Sulfuric acid is also formed in the process and reused in the leaching process. Every 24 to 48 hours, each cell is shut down, the zinc-coated cathodes are removed and rinsed, and the zinc is mechanically stripped from the aluminium plates.<ref name=epa/><ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nElectrolytic zinc smelters contain as many as several hundred cells. A portion of the electrical energy is converted into heat, which increases the temperature of the electrolyte. Electrolytic cells operate at temperature ranges from {{convert|30|to|35|C|F}} and at atmospheric pressure. A portion of the electrolyte is continuously circulated through the cooling towers both to cool and concentrate the electrolyte through evaporation of water. The cooled and concentrated electrolyte is then recycled to the cells.<ref name=epa/> This process accounts for approximately one-third of all the energy usage when smelting zinc.<ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nThere are two common processes for electrowinning the metal: the ''low current density'' process, and the ''Tainton high current density'' process. The former uses a 10% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte, with current density of 270\u2013325 amperes per square meter. The latter uses 22\u201328% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte with a current density of about 1,000 amperes per square metre. The latter gives better purity and has higher production capacity per volume of electrolyte, but has the disadvantage of running hotter and being more corrosive to the vessel in which it is done. In either of the electrolytic processes, each metric ton of zinc production expends about {{convert|3900|kW\u00b7h| GJ|abbr=on|lk=on}} of electric power.<ref name=\"samans\"/>\n\n===Melting and casting===\nDepending on the type of end-products produced, the zinc cathodes coming out of the electro-winning plant can undergo an additional transformation step in a foundry. Zinc cathodes are melted in induction furnaces and cast into marketable products such as ingots. Other metals and alloy components may be added to produce zinc containing alloys used in die-casting or general galvanization applications. Finally, molten zinc may be transported to nearby conversion plants or third parties using specially-designed insulated containers. This is the case with Balen and Budel.<ref name=nyrstar/>\n\n==Pyrometallurgical processes==\nThere are also several pyrometallurgical processes that reduce zinc oxide using carbon, then distil the metallic zinc from the resulting mix in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide. The major downfall of any of the pyrometallurgical process is that it is only 98% pure; a standard composition is 1.3% lead, 0.2% cadmium, 0.03% iron, and 98.5% zinc.<ref name=zh/> This may be pure enough for galvanization, but not enough for die casting alloys, which requires special high-grade zinc (99.995% pure).<ref name=zh/> In order to reach this purity the zinc must be [[zinc refining|refined]].\n\nThe four types of commercial pyrometallurgical processes are the ''[[St. Joe Minerals|St. Joseph Minerals Corporation's]]'' (electrothermic) process, the ''blast furnace'' process, the ''[[New Jersey Zinc Company|New Jersey Zinc]] continuous vertical-retort'' process, and the ''Belgian-type horizontal retort'' process.\n\n===St. Joseph Mineral Company (electrothermic) process===\nThis process was developed by the St. Joseph Mineral Company in 1930, and is the only pyrometallurgical process still used in the US to smelt zinc. The advantage of this system is that it is able to smelt a wide variety of zinc-bearing materials, including electric arc furnace dust.<ref name=epa/> The disadvantage of this process is that it is less efficient than the electrolysis process.<ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nThe process begins with a downdraft sintering operation. The sinter, which is a mixture of roaster calcine and EAF (electric arc furnace) calcine, is loaded onto a gate type conveyor and then combustions gases are pumped through the sinter. The carbon in the combustion gases react with some impurities, such as lead, cadmium, and halides. These impurities are driven off into filtration bags. The sinter after this process, called product sinter, usually has a composition of 48% zinc, 8% iron, 5% aluminium, 4% silicon, 2.5% calcium, and smaller quantities of magnesium, lead, and other metals. The sinter product is then charged with coke into an electric retort furnace. A pair of graphite electrodes from the top and bottom of the furnace produce current flow through the mixture. The coke provides electrical resistance to the mixture in order to heat the mixture to {{convert|1400|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and produce carbon monoxide. These conditions allow for the following chemical reaction to occur:\n\n:<chem>ZnO + CO -> Zn (^) + CO2</chem>\n\nThe zinc vapour and carbon dioxide pass to a vacuum condenser, where zinc is recovered by bubbling through a molten zinc bath. Over 95% of the zinc vapour leaving the retort is condensed to liquid zinc. The carbon dioxide is regenerated with carbon, and the carbon monoxide is recycled back to the retort furnace.<ref name=epa/>\n\n===Blast furnace process (Imperial Smelting Process)===\n{{see also|Blast furnace}}\nThis process was developed by the [[National Smelting Company]]  at [[Avonmouth Docks]], [[England]], in order to increase production, increase efficiency, and decrease labour and maintenance costs. L. J. Derham proposed using a spray of molten lead droplets to rapidly chill and absorb the zinc vapour, despite the high concentration of carbon dioxide. The mixture is then cooled, where the zinc separates from the lead. The first plant using this design opened up in 1950. One of the advantages of this process is that it can co-produce lead bullion and copper dross. In 1990, it accounted for 12% of the world's zinc production.\n\nThe process starts by charging solid sinter and heated coke into the top of the blast furnace. Preheated air at {{convert|190|to|1050|C|F|-1}} is blown into the bottom of the  furnace. Zinc vapour and sulfides leave through the top and enter the condenser. Slag and lead collect at the bottom of the furnace and are tapped off regularly. The zinc is scrubbed from the vapour in the condenser via liquid lead. The liquid zinc is separated from the lead in the cooling circuit. Approximately {{convert|5000|MT|ST|lk=on}} of lead are required each year for this process, however this process recovers 25% more lead from the starting ores than other processes.\n\n===New Jersey Zinc continuous vertical retort===\n[[File:New Jersey Zinc Vertical Retort Process (US Pat 2457552).svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram of New Jersey Zinc process, US Pat 2,457,552.]]\nThe New Jersey Zinc process<ref>{{US patent|src=uspto|2457552}}</ref> is no longer used to produce primary zinc in the U.S., in Europe and Japan, however it still is used to treat secondary operations. This process peaked in 1960, when it accounted for 5% of world zinc production. A modified version of this process is still used at Huludao, China, which produced 65,000 [[metric ton]]s per year.<ref name=zh/>\n\nThis process begins by roasting concentrates that are mixed with coal and [[briquette]]d in two stages. The briquettes are then heated in an [[wiktionary:autogenous|autogenous]] coker at {{convert|700|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and then charged into the retort. There are three reasons to briquette the calcine: to ensure free downward movement of the charge; to permit heat transfer across a practical size cross-section; to allow adequate porosity for the passage of reduced zinc vapour to the top of the retort. The reduced zinc vapour that is collected at the top of the retort is then condensed to a liquid.<ref name=zh/>\n\nOverpelt improved upon this design by using only one large condensation chamber, instead of many small ones, as it was originally designed. This allowed for the carbon monoxide to be recirculated into the furnaces for heating the retorts.<ref name=zh/>\n\nThis process was licensed to the Imperial Smelting Corporation (ISC), based in [[Avonmouth]], England, which had a large vertical retort (VR) plant in production for many years. It was used until the mid-1970s when it was superseded by the company's Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) plant. The VR plant was demolished in 1975.\n\n===Belgian-type horizontal retort process===\nThis process was the main process used in Britain from the mid-19th century until 1951.<ref name=zh>{{Citation | last = Porter | first = Frank | title = Zinc Handbook: Properties, Processing, and Use in Design | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 16\u201317 | year = 1991 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=laACw9i0D_wC | isbn = 0-8247-8340-9}}.</ref><ref name=brit/> The process was very inefficient as it was designed as a small scale batch operation.

[[Carbon monoxide]] produced by the charring of the organic material would have reduced the zinc oxide to zinc vapour, which then liquefied in a conical clay condenser at the bottom of the retort, dripping down into a collection vessel.

The chemical reactions that take place are as follows:\n\n:<chem>2ZnS + 3O2 -> 2ZnO + 2SO2</chem>\n\n:<chem>2SO2 + O2 -> 2SO3</chem>\n\nApproximately 90% of zinc in concentrates are oxidized to zinc oxide. However, at the roasting temperatures around 10% of the zinc reacts with the iron impurities of the zinc sulfide concentrates to form [[zinc ferrite]]. A byproduct of roasting is [[sulfur dioxide]], which is further processed into [[sulfuric acid]], a [[commodity]].<ref name=nyrstar/> The linked refinery flow sheet shows a schematic of Noranda's eastern Canadian zinc roasting operation<ref>Noranda's zinc roasting operation illustrated http://www.norandaincomefund.com/pdfs/refinery_flowsheet.pdf</ref>\n\nThe process of roasting varies based on the type of roaster used. There are three types of roasters: multiple-hearth, suspension, and fluidized-bed.<ref name=epa/>\n\n===Multiple-hearth roaster===\nIn a multiple-hearth roaster, the concentrate drops through a series of 9 or more hearths stacked inside a brick-lined cylindrical column. As the feed concentrate drops through the furnace, it is first dried by the hot gases passing through the hearths and then oxidized to produce calcine. The reactions are slow and can be sustained only by the addition of fuel. Multiple hearth roasters are unpressurized and operate at about {{convert|690|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|-1|abbr=on}}. Operating time depends upon the composition of concentrate and the amount of the sulfur removal required. Multiple hearth roasters have the capability of producing a high-purity calcine.<ref name=epa/>\n\n===Suspension roaster===\nIn a suspension roaster, the concentrates are blown into a combustion chamber very similar to that of a pulverized coal furnace. The roaster consists of a refractory-lined cylindrical steel shell, with a large combustion space at the top and 2 to 4 hearths in the lower portion, similar to those of a multiple hearth furnace. Additional grinding, beyond that required for a multiple hearth furnace, is normally required to ensure that heat transfer to the material is sufficiently rapid for the desulfurization and oxidation reactions to occur in the furnace chamber. Suspension roasters are unpressurized and operate at about {{convert|980|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=epa/>\n\n===Fluidized-bed roaster===\nIn a fluidized-bed roaster, finely ground sulfide concentrates are suspended and oxidized in a feedstock bed supported on an air column. As in the suspension roaster, the reaction rates for desulfurization are more rapid than in the older multiple-hearth processes. Fluidized-bed roasters operate under a pressure slightly lower than atmospheric and at temperatures averaging {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. In the fluidized-bed process, no additional fuel is required after ignition has been achieved. The major advantages of this roaster are greater throughput capacities, greater sulfur removal capabilities, and lower maintenance.<ref name=epa/>\n\n==Electrolysis process==\nThe electrolysis process, also known as the hydrometallurgical process, Roast-Leach-Electrowin (RLE) process, or electrolytic process, is more widely used than the pyrometallurgical processes.<ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nThe electrolysis process consists of 4 steps: leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting and casting.\n\n===Leaching===\n{{main|Leaching (metallurgy)}}\n\nThe basic leaching chemical formula that drives this process is:\n\n:<chem>ZnO + SO3 -> ZnSO4</chem>\n\nThis is achieved in practice through a process called double leaching. The calcine is first leached in a neutral or slightly acidic solution (of sulfuric acid) in order to leach the zinc out of the zinc oxide. The remaining calcine is then leached in strong sulfuric acid to leach the rest of the zinc out of the zinc oxide and zinc ferrite. The result of this process is a solid and a liquid; the liquid contains the zinc and is often called leach product; the solid is called leach residue and contains precious metals (usually lead and silver) which are sold as a by-product. There is also iron in the leach product from the strong acid leach, which is removed in an intermediate step, in the form of [[goethite]], [[jarosite]], and [[haematite]]. There is still [[cadmium]], [[copper]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[cobalt]], [[germanium]], [[nickel]], and [[thallium]] in the leach product. Therefore, it needs to be purified.<ref name=epa/><ref name=nyrstar/>\n\n===Purification===\n{{main|Cementation (metallurgy)}}\n\nThe purification process utilizes the cementation process to further purify the zinc. It uses zinc dust and steam to remove copper, cadmium, cobalt, and nickel, which would interfere with the electrolysis process. After purification, concentrations of these impurities are limited to less than 0.05 milligram per liter (4\u00d710<sup>\u22127</sup> pound per U.S. gallon). Purification is usually conducted in large agitated tanks. The process takes place at temperatures ranging from {{convert|40|to|85|C|F}}, and pressures ranging from atmospheric to {{convert|2.4|atm|kPa|-1|abbr=on}} (absolute scale). The by-products are sold for further refining.<ref name=epa/><ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nThe zinc sulfate solution must be very pure for electrowinning to be at all efficient. Impurities can change the decomposition voltage enough to where the electrolysis cell produces largely hydrogen gas rather than zinc metal.<ref name=\"samans\">{{Citation |title=Engineering Metals and their Alloys |last=Samans |first=Carl H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1949 |publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |isbn= |pages= | postscript =.}}</ref>\n\n===Electrolysis===\n{{main|Electrowinning}}\n\nZinc is extracted from the purified zinc sulfate solution by [[electrowinning]], which is a specialized form of electrolysis. The process works by passing an electric current through the solution in a series of cells. This causes the zinc to deposit on the cathodes ([[aluminium]] sheets) and oxygen to form at the anodes. Sulfuric acid is also formed in the process and reused in the leaching process. Every 24 to 48 hours, each cell is shut down, the zinc-coated cathodes are removed and rinsed, and the zinc is mechanically stripped from the aluminium plates.<ref name=epa/><ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nElectrolytic zinc smelters contain as many as several hundred cells. A portion of the electrical energy is converted into heat, which increases the temperature of the electrolyte. Electrolytic cells operate at temperature ranges from {{convert|30|to|35|C|F}} and at atmospheric pressure. A portion of the electrolyte is continuously circulated through the cooling towers both to cool and concentrate the electrolyte through evaporation of water. The cooled and concentrated electrolyte is then recycled to the cells.<ref name=epa/> This process accounts for approximately one-third of all the energy usage when smelting zinc.<ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nThere are two common processes for electrowinning the metal: the ''low current density'' process, and the ''Tainton high current density'' process. The former uses a 10% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte, with current density of 270\u2013325 amperes per square meter. The latter uses 22\u201328% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte with a current density of about 1,000 amperes per square metre. The latter gives better purity and has higher production capacity per volume of electrolyte, but has the disadvantage of running hotter and being more corrosive to the vessel in which it is done. In either of the electrolytic processes, each metric ton of zinc production expends about {{convert|3900|kW\u00b7h| GJ|abbr=on|lk=on}} of electric power.<ref name=\"samans\"/>\n\n===Melting and casting===\nDepending on the type of end-products produced, the zinc cathodes coming out of the electro-winning plant can undergo an additional transformation step in a foundry. Zinc cathodes are melted in induction furnaces and cast into marketable products such as ingots. Other metals and alloy components may be added to produce zinc containing alloys used in die-casting or general galvanization applications. Finally, molten zinc may be transported to nearby conversion plants or third parties using specially-designed insulated containers. This is the case with Balen and Budel.<ref name=nyrstar/>\n\n==Pyrometallurgical processes==\nThere are also several pyrometallurgical processes that reduce zinc oxide using carbon, then distil the metallic zinc from the resulting mix in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide. The major downfall of any of the pyrometallurgical process is that it is only 98% pure; a standard composition is 1.3% lead, 0.2% cadmium, 0.03% iron, and 98.5% zinc.<ref name=zh/> This may be pure enough for galvanization, but not enough for die casting alloys, which requires special high-grade zinc (99.995% pure).<ref name=zh/> In order to reach this purity the zinc must be [[zinc refining|refined]].\n\nThe four types of commercial pyrometallurgical processes are the ''[[St. Joe Minerals|St. Joseph Minerals Corporation's]]'' (electrothermic) process, the ''blast furnace'' process, the ''[[New Jersey Zinc Company|New Jersey Zinc]] continuous vertical-retort'' process, and the ''Belgian-type horizontal retort'' process.\n\n===St. Joseph Mineral Company (electrothermic) process===\nThis process was developed by the St. Joseph Mineral Company in 1930, and is the only pyrometallurgical process still used in the US to smelt zinc. The advantage of this system is that it is able to smelt a wide variety of zinc-bearing materials, including electric arc furnace dust.<ref name=epa/> The disadvantage of this process is that it is less efficient than the electrolysis process.<ref name=nyrstar/>\n\nThe process begins with a downdraft sintering operation. The sinter, which is a mixture of roaster calcine and EAF calcine, is loaded onto a gate type conveyor and then combustions gases are pumped through the sinter. The carbon in the combustion gases react with some impurities, such as lead, cadmium, and halides. These impurities are driven off into filtration bags. The sinter after this process, called product sinter, usually has a composition of 48% zinc, 8% iron, 5% aluminium, 4% silicon, 2.5% calcium, and smaller quantities of magnesium, lead, and other metals. The sinter product is then charged with coke into an electric retort furnace. A pair of graphite electrodes from the top and bottom of the furnace produce current flow through the mixture. The coke provides electrical resistance to the mixture in order to heat the mixture to {{convert|1400|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and produce carbon monoxide. These conditions allow for the following chemical reaction to occur:\n\n:<chem>ZnO + CO -> Zn (^) + CO2</chem>\n\nThe zinc vapour and carbon dioxide pass to a vacuum condenser, where zinc is recovered by bubbling through a molten zinc bath. Over 95% of the zinc vapour leaving the retort is condensed to liquid zinc. The carbon dioxide is regenerated with carbon, and the carbon monoxide is recycled back to the retort furnace.<ref name=epa/>\n\n===Blast furnace process (Imperial Smelting Process)===\n{{see also|Blast furnace}}\nThis process was developed by the [[National Smelting Company]]  at [[Avonmouth Docks]], [[England]], in order to increase production, increase efficiency, and decrease labour and maintenance costs. L. J. Derham proposed using a spray of molten lead droplets to rapidly chill and absorb the zinc vapour, despite the high concentration of carbon dioxide. The mixture is then cooled, where the zinc separates from the lead. The first plant using this design opened up in 1950. One of the advantages of this process is that it can co-produce lead bullion and copper dross. In 1990, it accounted for 12% of the world's zinc production.\n\nThe process starts by charging solid sinter and heated coke into the top of the blast furnace. Preheated air at {{convert|190|to|1050|C|F|-1}} is blown into the bottom of the  furnace. Zinc vapour and sulfides leave through the top and enter the condenser. Slag and lead collect at the bottom of the furnace and are tapped off regularly. The zinc is scrubbed from the vapour in the condenser via liquid lead. The liquid zinc is separated from the lead in the cooling circuit. Approximately {{convert|5000|MT|ST|lk=on}} of lead are required each year for this process, however this process recovers 25% more lead from the starting ores than other processes.\n\n===New Jersey Zinc continuous vertical retort===\n[[File:New Jersey Zinc Vertical Retort Process (US Pat 2457552).svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram of New Jersey Zinc process, US Pat 2,457,552.]]\nThe New Jersey Zinc process<ref>{{US patent|src=uspto|2457552}}</ref> is no longer used to produce primary zinc in the U.S., in Europe and Japan, however it still is used to treat secondary operations. This process peaked in 1960, when it accounted for 5% of world zinc production. A modified version of this process is still used at Huludao, China, which produced 65,000 [[metric ton]]s per year.<ref name=zh/>\n\nThis process begins by roasting concentrates that are mixed with coal and [[briquette]]d in two stages. The briquettes are then heated in an [[wiktionary:autogenous|autogenous]] coker at {{convert|700|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and then charged into the retort. There are three reasons to briquette the calcine: to ensure free downward movement of the charge; to permit heat transfer across a practical size cross-section; to allow adequate porosity for the passage of reduced zinc vapour to the top of the retort. The reduced zinc vapour that is collected at the top of the retort is then condensed to a liquid.<ref name=zh/>\n\nOverpelt improved upon this design by using only one large condensation chamber, instead of many small ones, as it was originally designed. This allowed for the carbon monoxide to be recirculated into the furnaces for heating the retorts.<ref name=zh/>\n\nThis process was licensed to the Imperial Smelting Corporation (ISC), based in [[Avonmouth]], England, which had a large vertical retort (VR) plant in production for many years. It was used until the mid-1970s when it was superseded by the company's Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) plant. The VR plant was demolished in 1975.\n\n===Belgian-type horizontal retort process===\nThis process was the main process used in Britain from the mid-19th century until 1951.<ref name=zh>{{Citation | last = Porter | first = Frank | title = Zinc Handbook: Properties, Processing, and Use in Design | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 16\u201317 | year = 1991 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=laACw9i0D_wC | isbn = 0-8247-8340-9}}.</ref><ref name=brit/> The process was very inefficient as it was designed as a small scale batch operation.

[[Carbon monoxide]] produced by the charring of the organic material would have reduced the zinc oxide to zinc vapour, which then liquefied in a conical clay condenser at the bottom of the retort, dripping down into a collection vessel.

While not strictly a castle, it is built in the style of a fortified mansion. It pre-dates the [[Scottish Baronial]] style of architecture, and may have been one of the influences on this style. It contains a brewery.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Traquair House, 1814.jpg|left|thumb|Traquair House in 1814]]\nThe house is built on the site of a hunting seat used by the Scottish kings from the 12th century, though no part of the present building can be dated with certainty before the 15th century. [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] was the first Scottish king to stay and hunt at Traquair. At that time it was a remote \"castle\", surrounded by forest. Upon [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III's]] death in 1286, the peace of the [[Scottish Borders|Borders region]] was shattered and Traquair became a key link in the chain of defence that guarded the Tweed Valley against English invasion.\n\nOver the next two centuries Traquair's ownership changed often, at times coming under the control of the English, and at others, the Scottish throne. In the 1460s James III conferred the estate on Dr. William Rogers, an eminent musician, and one of his favourites. After holding the lands for upwards of nine years, Dr. Rogers sold them for an insignificant sum in 1478 to [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Buchan|the Earl of Buchan]]. The Earl gifted the estate to his illegitimate son, James Stuart (1480-1513), 1st [[Laird]] of [[Traquair]], in 1491. James Stuart obtained letters of legitimation and married the heiress of the Rutherfords, with whom he received the estates of Rutherford and Wells in [[Roxburghshire]]. He was killed at the [[Battle of Flodden]]. His daughter, Jane Stewart, had a daughter Janet born out of wedlock with the [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus|Earl of Angus]], who married [[Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven]].\n\nTraquair remained the family seat of the [[Earl of Traquair|Earls of Traquair]] for the next four centuries.\n\nIn 1875 Traquair passed to a cousin of the Stuarts, Henry Constable Maxwell. He was a direct descendant, but via the female line. The [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]  holds a 1992 portrait of Catherine Maxwell Stuart, 21st Lady of Traquair.<ref>{{cite web |title=Catherine Maxwell Stuart, 21st Lady of Traquair |url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp143307/catherine-maxwell-stuart-21st-lady-of-traquair |website=National Portrait Gallery |publisher=National Portrait Gallery, London 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018 |quote=Catherine Maxwell Stuart, 21st Lady of Traquair by Bob Collins NPG x137506 -  September 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n\nTraquair is a 50-room house. The rooms include \"The Drawing Room\", containing ancestral portraits and photographs of the current residents; \"The Dressing Room\", which is decorated to demonstrate life in former times; \"The Museum Room\", containing a mural dating from 1530, one of the oldest to survive in a secular building in Scotland, as well as charters stamped with the royal seals and signatures of the Scottish Kings; \"The King's Room\", where [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] stayed in 1566 and which contains some relics belonging to her and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], such as her rosary, crucifix, purse, a silk quilt, and letters bearing her signature; \"The Still Room\", where breakfast is taken among the 18th century porcelain that decorates the shelves; and \"The Dining Room\", one of the last additions to the house, built in the late 17th century. There is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] chapel built in 1829, following the [[Catholic emancipation]]. The 18th century library contains more than 3,000 volumes. Although three lairds made alterations to the house prior to the 17th century, Traquair has changed little, architecturally, since then.\n\nThe Bear Gates at the main entrance to the grounds were installed by the fifth Earl, Charles Stuart, in 1738.

While not strictly a castle, it is built in the style of a fortified mansion. It pre-dates the [[Scottish Baronial]] style of architecture, and may have been one of the influences on this style. It contains a brewery.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Traquair House, 1814.jpg|left|thumb|Traquair House in 1814]]\nThe house is built on the site of a hunting seat used by the Scottish kings from the 12th century, though no part of the present building can be dated with certainty before the 15th century. [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] was the first Scottish king to stay and hunt at Traquair. At that time it was a remote \"castle\", surrounded by forest.

20, 2009 edition of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' magazine, [[Bill Kauffman]] told readers to \"keep an eye out\" for a Johnson presidential campaign in 2012, reporting that Johnson had told him that \"he was keeping his options open for 2012\" and that \"he may take a shot at the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 as an antiwar, anti-[[Federal Reserve System|Fed]], pro-personal liberties, slash-government-spending candidate\u2014in other words, a Ron Paul libertarian\".<ref name=\"Kauffman\" />  During a June 24, 2009 appearance on [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Freedom Watch]]'', host Judge [[Andrew Napolitano]] asked Johnson if he would run for president in 2012, to which Johnson responded that he thought it would be inappropriate to openly express his desires before President Obama is given the opportunity to prove himself, but he followed up that statement by saying \"it appears personal freedoms are being shoveled out the window more and more.\"<ref>{{cite video |url =

to help him raise funds and promote small government ideas. In December 2009, Johnson asked strategist Ron Nielson of NSON Opinion Strategy, who has worked with Johnson since 1993 when he ran his successful gubernatorial campaign, to organize the Our American Initiative as a [[501(c)(4)]] committee. Nielson serves as a senior advisor to Our America Initiative.

Warnings were then issued via the media and patrols using loudspeakers, warning residents throughout the Chicago metropolitan area to discontinue use of Tylenol products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPolice, knowing that various sources of Tylenol were tampered with, ruled out manufacturers, as the tampered-with bottles came from different pharmaceutical companies\u2014and the seven deaths had all occurred in the Chicago area, so sabotage during production was ruled out. Instead, police concluded that they were likely looking for a culprit who was believed to have acquired bottles of Tylenol from various retail outlets.<ref name=\"PBSNewsHour\" /> Furthermore, they concluded the source was most likely supermarkets and drug stores, over a period of several weeks, with the culprit likely adding the cyanide to the capsules, then methodically returning to the stores to place the bottles back on the shelves.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to the five bottles that led to the victims' deaths, three other contaminated bottles were later discovered.\n\nIn a concerted effort to reassure the public, [[Johnson & Johnson]] distributed warnings to hospitals and distributors and halted Tylenol production and advertising. On October 5, 1982, it issued a nationwide [[Product recall|recall]] of Tylenol products; an estimated 31 million bottles were in circulation, with a retail value of over US $100 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|100|1982|r=0}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).<ref>Emsley, John.

Some tools specifically avoid removing these stop words to support [[phrase search]].\n\nAny group of words can be chosen as the stop words for a given purpose. For some [[search engine]]s, these are some of the most common, short [[function word]]s, such as ''the'', ''is'', ''at'', ''which'', and ''on''. In this case, stop words can cause problems when searching for phrases that include them, particularly in names such as \"[[The Who]]\", \"[[The The]]\", or \"[[Take That]]\". Other search engines remove some of the most common words\u2014including [[lexical word]]s, such as \"want\"\u2014from a query in order to improve performance.<ref>[http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/podcast-32 Stackoverflow]: \"One of our major performance optimizations for the \"related questions\" query is removing the top 10,000 most common English dictionary words (as determined by Google search) before submitting the query to the SQL Server 2008 full text engine.

He the son of a [[pub]]lican, O'Leary was educated at [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork|Presentation College]], [[University College Cork]], [[Columbia University]], and [[King's Inns]]. On returning to Ireland, he became involved in the Labour Party and was employed as Education Officer for the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]] (ITGWU). In this r\u00f4le he was instrumental in establishing the Universities Branch, affiliated to [[Dublin North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-Central]] constituency, bringing together [[Dublin University]] Fabian Society and [[University College Dublin]] Labour Party students.\n\n==Political career==\nO'Leary was first elected to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] as a Labour Party [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] for [[Dublin North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-Central]] at the [[1965 Irish general election|1965 general election]].<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=2761|title=Michael O'Leary|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> His agent was Bob Mitchell, Chairman of Dublin University Fabian Society, who could claim credit in a dirty campaign for picking up transfers to squeeze out the Labour Party front-runner on the 11th recount.\n\nWhen he was first elected to the D\u00e1il, O'Leary encouraged the Labour Party to take a more left-wing stance in its policies. He was initially strongly opposed to the idea of a [[Coalition government|coalition]] with [[Fine Gael]], but following the [[1969 Irish general election|1969 general election]] he believed that there was a need for a new approach. When the Labour Party and [[Fine Gael]] formed the National Coalition government following the [[1973 Irish general election|1973 general election]] he was appointed [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Minister for Labour]].\n\nIn 1977, he was narrowly defeated by [[Frank Cluskey]] for the leadership of the party. O'Leary was elected to the [[European Parliament]] for the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]] constituency.\n\nCluskey resigned as Labour Party leader when he lost his D\u00e1il seat at the [[1981 Irish general election|1981 general election]] and O'Leary was elected unanimously to succeed him. In the short-lived [[Government of the 22nd D\u00e1il|Fine Gael\u2013Labour Party government]] of 1981 to 1982, O'Leary became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht|Minister for Energy]]. Shortly after the government's defeat at the [[February 1982 Irish general election|February 1982 general election]] he resigned as leader of the Labour Party and joined [[Fine Gael]], subsequently being elected a TD for that party in the [[Dublin South-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin South-West]] constituency at the [[November 1982 Irish general election|November 1982 general election]]. He was kept out of cabinet office by his former Labour colleagues.\n\nIn 1985, O'Leary introduced a [[private member's bill]] on divorce which forced the government into holding the [[Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986|1986 divorce referendum]].\n\nWhen the [[Progressive Democrats]] were formed in 1985 he considered joining, but remained loyal to Fine Gael and [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]].\n\nHe did not contest the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]] and afterwards he moved back to Cork and practised as a barrister. He was elected as a Fine Gael member of [[Cork City Council]] at the [[1991 Irish local elections|1991 local elections]]. He unsuccessfully contested the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] in [[Cork North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork North-Central]] and received about 2% of the valid poll.<ref

1982, [[Leader of the Labour Party (Ireland)|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1981 to 1982 and [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Minister for Labour]] from 1973 to 1977. He served as a [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) from 1965 to 1977, 1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1987. He was a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) from 1979 to 1984.<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Michael-O'Leary.D.1965-04-21/|title=Michael O'Leary|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=25 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe resigned from the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] in 1982 to join [[Fine Gael]]. \n\n==Early life==\nO'Leary was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1936. He the son of a [[pub]]lican, O'Leary was educated at [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork|Presentation College]], [[University College Cork]], [[Columbia University]], and [[King's Inns]]. On returning to Ireland, he became involved in the Labour Party and was employed as Education Officer for the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]] (ITGWU). In this r\u00f4le he was instrumental in establishing the Universities Branch, affiliated to [[Dublin North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-Central]] constituency, bringing together [[Dublin University]] Fabian Society and [[University College Dublin]] Labour Party students.\n\n==Political career==\nO'Leary was first elected to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] as a Labour Party [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] for [[Dublin North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-Central]] at the [[1965 Irish general election|1965 general election]].<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=2761|title=Michael O'Leary|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> His agent was Bob Mitchell, Chairman of Dublin University Fabian Society, who could claim credit in a dirty campaign for picking up transfers to squeeze out the Labour Party front-runner on the 11th recount.\n\nWhen he was first elected to the D\u00e1il, O'Leary encouraged the Labour Party to take a more left-wing stance in its policies. He was initially strongly opposed to the idea of a [[Coalition government|coalition]] with [[Fine Gael]], but following the [[1969 Irish general election|1969 general election]] he believed that there was a need for a new approach. When the Labour Party and [[Fine Gael]] formed the National Coalition government following the [[1973 Irish general election|1973 general election]] he was appointed [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Minister for Labour]].\n\nIn 1977, he was narrowly defeated by [[Frank Cluskey]] for the leadership of the party. O'Leary was elected to the [[European Parliament]] for the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]] constituency.\n\nCluskey resigned as Labour Party leader when he lost his D\u00e1il seat at the [[1981 Irish general election|1981 general election]] and O'Leary was elected unanimously to succeed him. In the short-lived [[Government of the 22nd D\u00e1il|Fine Gael\u2013Labour Party government]] of 1981 to 1982, O'Leary became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht|Minister for Energy]]. Shortly after the governments defeat at the [[February 1982 Irish general election|February 1982 general election]] he resigned as leader of the Labour Party and joined [[Fine Gael]], subsequently being elected a TD for that party in the [[Dublin South-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin South-West]] constituency at the [[November 1982 Irish general election|November 1982 general election]]. He was kept out of cabinet office by his former Labour colleagues.\n\nIn 1985, O'Leary introduced a [[private member's bill]] on divorce which forced the government into holding the [[Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986|1986 divorce referendum]].\n\nWhen the [[Progressive Democrats]] were formed in 1985 he considered joining, but remained loyal to Fine Gael and [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]].\n\nHe did not contest the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]] and afterwards he moved back to Cork and practised as a barrister. He was elected as a Fine Gael member of [[Cork City Council]] at the [[1991 Irish local elections|1991 local elections]]. He unsuccessfully contested the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] in [[Cork North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork North-Central]] and received about 2% of the valid poll.<ref name=RTE_20060512/>\n\nHe was appointed a [[Courts of the Republic of Ireland|District Court]] judge in 1997 by the Fine Gael\u2013Labour Party\u2013[[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] coalition government.\n\n==Death==\nO'Leary died in [[France]] in May 2006, following a drowning accident in a swimming pool.<ref name=RTE_20060512>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0512/olearym.html|title=Former T\u00e1naiste Michael O'Leary dies in France|work=[[RT\u00c9 News]]|date=12 May 2006}}</ref> He was on holiday, having retired as a judge just days earlier.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MEP|752|Michael O'Leary}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[Joseph Brennan (Fianna F\u00e1il politician)|Joseph Brennan]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title  = [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Minister for Labour]]\n       |years  = 1973\u20131977}}\n{{s-aft|after  = [[Gene Fitzgerald]]}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[George Colley]]|rows = 2}}\n{{s-ttl|title  = [[T\u00e1naiste]]\n       |years  = 1981\u20131982}}\n{{s-aft|after  = [[Ray MacSharry]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title  = [[Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht|Minister for Energy]]\n       |years  = 1981\u20131982}}\n{{s-aft|after  = [[Albert Reynolds]]}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[Frank Cluskey]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title  = [[Leader of the Labour Party (Ireland)|Leader of the Labour Party]]\n       |years  = 1981\u20131982}}\n{{s-aft|after  = [[Dick Spring]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Deputy heads of government of Ireland}}\n{{14th Government of Ireland}}\n{{17th Government of Ireland}}\n{{Members of the European Parliament for Ireland (1979\u20131984)}}\n{{Labour Party (Ireland)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oleary, Michael}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Cork (city)]]\n[[Category:Deaths by drowning]]\n[[Category:Leaders of the Labour Party (Ireland)]]\n[[Category:Fine Gael TDs]]\n[[Category:Irish barristers]]\n[[Category:Politicians from County Cork]]\n[[Category:T\u00e1naist\u00ed]]\n[[Category:Members of the 18th D\u00e1il]]\n[[Category:Members of the 19th D\u00e1il]]\n[[Category:Members of the 20th D\u00e1il]]\n[[Category:Members of the 21st D\u00e1il]]\n[[Category:Members of the 22nd D\u00e1il]]\n[[Category:Members of the 23rd D\u00e1il]]\n[[Category:Members of the 24th D\u00e1il]]\n[[Category:Accidental deaths in France]]\n[[Category:Labour Party (Ireland) MEPs]]\n[[Category:MEPs for the Republic of Ireland 1979\u20131984]]\n[[Category:People educated at Presentation Brothers College, Cork]]\n[[Category:Labour Party (Ireland) TDs]]\n[[Category:Alumni of King's Inns]]\n", "name_user": "Julia H.

Joe himself was soon evicted from the show.\n\nBig Brother added another twist to the game on day 79 by cancelling the day's scheduled nominations and making the housemates believe they will instead be evicted based on their performances on assigned tasks while in reality no more evictions were held and viewers began voting for the winner who turned out to be 26-year-old Katung Aduwak.\n\n====Nominations Table====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; font-size:85%; line-height:15px;\"\n! style=\"width:8%\"|\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 2\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 3\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 4\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 5\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 6\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 7\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 8\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 9\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 10\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 11\n! style=\"width:8%\" colspan=\"2\"|Week 13<br>Final\n! style=\"width:1%\"|Nominations received\n|-\n! style=\"background:#000\" colspan=\"14\"|\n|-\n!

In a twist to the game, two new contestants were introduced on Day 23, much to the excitement of the remaining housemates.\n\n[[Ebuka]], the most popular housemate for several weeks into the show and widely believed to emerge the winner was the seventh housemate to be evicted; many viewers blame the Joe's Fan Club (JFC) for his eviction. Joe himself was soon evicted from the show.\n\nBig Brother added another twist to the game on day 79 by cancelling the day's scheduled nominations and making the housemates believe they will instead be evicted based on their performances on assigned tasks while in reality no more evictions were held and viewers began voting for the winner who turned out to be 26-year-old Katung Aduwak.\n\n====Nominations Table====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; font-size:85%; line-height:15px;\"\n! style=\"width:8%\"|\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 2\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 3\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 4\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 5\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 6\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 7\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 8\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 9\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 10\n! style=\"width:8%\"|Week 11\n! style=\"width:8%\" colspan=\"2\"|Week 13<br>Final\n! style=\"width:1%\"|Nominations received\n|-\n! style=\"background:#000\" colspan=\"14\"|\n|-\n!
