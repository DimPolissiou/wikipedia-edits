The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species responsible for the silica dissolution do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Catalysis of ASR by NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):  \n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>   &rarr;  CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silicic acid at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of NaOH or KOH responsible for a high pH (~13.5), the amorphous silica would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).   \n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp;  || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the [[porosity]] of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit [[rebreather|diving rebreathers]] and in [[anesthesia]] systems.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:  \n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.  \n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nThere are no treatments in general in affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, drying of the structure followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]] can stop the evolution of the reaction.\n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==ASR test==\nSome tests that screen aggregates or concrete for the potential of ASR include:\n\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.''

The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species responsible for the silica dissolution do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Catalysis of ASR by NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):  \n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>   &rarr;  CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silicic acid at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of NaOH or KOH responsible for a high pH (~13.5), the amorphous silica would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).   \n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp;  || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the [[porosity]] of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit [[rebreather|diving rebreathers]] and in [[anesthesia]] systems.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:  \n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water.

(Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity. Indeed, some siliceous limestones (a.o., ''[[Kieselkalk]]'' found in [[Switzerland]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Funk|first=Hanspeter|year=1975|title=The origin of authigenic quartz in the Helvetic Siliceous Limestone (Helvetischer Kieselkalk), Switzerland|journal=Sedimentology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=299\u2013306|bibcode=1975Sedim..22..299F|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1975.tb00296.x}}<!--| accessdate = 2009-03-17\n--></ref> may be cemented by amorphous or poorly crystalline silica and can be very sensitive to the ASR reaction, as also observed with some Tournaisian siliceous limestones exploited in quarries in the area of [[Tournai]] in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Monnin\n| first = Y.\n|author2=D\u00e9grugilliers P. |author3=Bulteel D. |author4=Garcia-Diaz E.\n | year = 2006\n| title = Petrography study of two siliceous limestones submitted to alkali-silica reaction\n| journal = Cement and Concrete Research\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1460\u20131466\n| issn = 0008-8846\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.025\n}}</ref> In Canada, the Spratt siliceous limestone is also particularly well known in studies dealing with ASR and is commonly used as the Canadian ASR reference aggregate. So, the use of limestone as aggregate is not a guarantee against ASR in itself.\n# Add very fine siliceous materials to neutralize the excessive [[alkalinity]] of cement with [[silicic acid]] by deliberately provoking a controlled [[pozzolanic reaction]] at the early stage of the cement setting. Convenient pozzolanic materials to add to the mix may be, ''e.g.'', [[pozzolan]], [[silica fume]], [[fly ash]], or [[metakaolin]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Ramlochan\n| first = Terrence\n|author2=Michael Thomas |author3=Karen A.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.  \n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nThere are no treatments in general in affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, drying of the structure followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]] can stop the evolution of the reaction.\n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==ASR test==\nSome tests that screen aggregates for the potential of ASR include:\n\n*ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n*ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n*ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n*ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d.

It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n*ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n*The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.''

Functionally, the national varieties of SE are characterized by generally accepted rules, often [[Grammar|grammars]] established by [[linguistic prescription]] in the 18th century.<ref>[[#smith1996|Smith 1996]]</ref>\n\nEnglish originated in [[England]] during the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon period]], and is now spoken as a [[First language|first]] or [[English as a second language|second language]] in many countries of the world, many of which have developed one or more \"national standards\" (though this does not refer to [[Technical standard|published standards documents]], but to frequency of consistent usage). English is the first language of the majority of the population [[List of countries by English-speaking population|in a number of countries]], including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Bahamas]] and [[Barbados]] and is an official language in [[List of countries where English is an official language|many others]], including; [[India]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Nigeria]]; each country has a standard English with a grammar, spelling and pronunciation particular to the local culture.\n\nAs the result of [[colonisation]] and historical migrations of English-speaking populations, and the predominant use of English as the international language of trade and commerce (a ''[[lingua franca]]''), English has also become the most widely used second language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/globalenglish/ |title=Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Askoxford.com |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> In countries where English is neither a native language nor widely spoken, a non-native{{what|date=June 2019}} variant (typically [[English language in England|English English]] or [[North American English]]) might be considered \"standard\" for teaching purposes. <ref>Trudgill and Hannah, ''International English'', pp. 1-2.</ref> Typically, British English is taught as standard across [[Europe]], the [[Caribbean]], [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[South Asia]], and American English is taught as standard across [[Latin America]] and [[East Asia]]. This does, however, vary between regions and individual teachers. In some areas a [[pidgin]] or [[creole language]]<!--Note: \"creole\" is not a proper name in this construction; it refers to creolization of language, not Creole/Criollo peoples.-->, blends English with one or more native languages.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|English grammar}}\nAlthough the standard Englishes of the [[Anglosphere|anglophone countries]] are similar, there are minor grammatical differences and divergences of [[vocabulary]] among the varieties. In American and Australian English, for example, \"sunk\" and \"shrunk\" as past-tense forms of \"sink\" and \"shrink\" are acceptable as standard forms, whereas standard British English retains the past-tense forms of \"sank\" and \"shrank\".<ref>[[#varieties3|Burridge and Kortmann 2008]]</ref> In South African English, the deletion of verbal complements is becoming common. This phenomenon sees the objects of transitive verbs being omitted: \"Did you get?\", \"You can put in the box\".<ref>[[#varieties4|Mesthrie 2008]]</ref> This kind of construction is infrequent in most other standardized varieties of English.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n{{further|Comparison of American and British English}}\n{{Empty section|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Spelling ==\n{{Main|English orthography}}\n{{further|American and British English spelling differences}}\n\nWith rare exceptions, Standard Englishes use either American or British spelling systems, or a mixture of the two (such as in [[Australian English]], [[Canadian English]], and [[Indian English|Indian English spelling]]).
