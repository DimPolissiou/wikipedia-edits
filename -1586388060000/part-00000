Thirty-five of the 100 seats in the [[United States Senate]] and all 435 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] were contested. Thirty-nine state and territorial [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] as well as numerous state and local elections were also contested.\n\nIn the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House of Representatives]], Democrats made a net gain of 41 seats.{{efn|name=undecided|Democrats won a net gain of 40 seats on election day, but gained one more seat in a [[2018 Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district special election|special election]] held earlier in 2018. One House seat in North Carolina remained vacant after the elections due to allegations of election fraud; a [[2019 North Carolina's 9th congressional district special election|special election]] filled it in 2019.}} The Democratic Party gained a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, thereby ending the [[Government trifecta|federal trifecta]] that the Republican Party had established in the [[United States elections, 2016|2016 elections]]. In the [[2018 United States Senate elections|United States Senate]], Republicans expanded their majority by two seats, despite Democratic candidates receiving 52 million votes nationwide, while Republican candidates received 34 million. As a result of the 2018 elections, the [[116th United States Congress]] became the first Congress since the [[99th United States Congress]] ([[1984 United States elections|elected in 1984]]) in which the Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives and the Republicans control the U.S. Senate. In the state elections, Democrats gained seven state governorships, control of at least 350 state legislative seats, and control of six state legislative chambers.\n \nThe elections marked the highest [[voter turnout]] seen in midterm elections since [[United States elections, 1914|1914]]. The elections saw several electoral firsts for women, racial minorities and [[LGBT]] candidates, including the election of the [[Jared Polis|first openly gay governor]] and the [[Kyrsten Sinema|first openly bisexual U.S. senator]]. In various referenda, numerous states voted to expand [[Medicaid]] coverage, require [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter identification]], establish independent [[redistricting commission]]s, legalize [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], repeal [[felony disenfranchisement]] laws and enact other proposals.\n\nDuring the campaign, Democrats focused on health care, frequently attacking Republicans for supporting repeal of provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also known as Obamacare), including protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Republican messaging focused on immigration and the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. There were [[Russian interference in the 2018 United States elections|allegations of attempted Russian interference in these elections]] as well as [[Voter suppression in the United States#2017\u20132018|controversies regarding potential voter suppression]] and other alleged election irregularities.

Thirty-five of the 100 seats in the [[United States Senate]] and all 435 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] were contested. Thirty-nine state and territorial [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] as well as numerous state and local elections were also contested.\n\nIn the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House of Representatives]], Democrats made a net gain of 41 seats.{{efn|name=undecided|Democrats won a net gain of 40 seats on election day, but gained one more seat in a [[2018 Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district special election|special election]] held earlier in 2018. One House seat in North Carolina remained vacant after the elections due to allegations of election fraud; a [[2019 North Carolina's 9th congressional district special election|special election]] filled it in 2019.}} The Democratic Party gained a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, thereby ending the [[Government trifecta|federal trifecta]] that the Republican Party had established in the [[United States elections, 2016|2016 elections]]. In the [[2018 United States Senate elections|United States Senate]], Republicans expanded their majority by two seats, despite Democratic candidates receiving 52 million votes nationwide, while Republican candidates received 34 million. As a result of the 2018 elections, the [[116th United States Congress]] became the first Congress since the [[99th United States Congress]] ([[1984 United States elections|elected in 1984]]) in which the Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives and the Republicans control the U.S. Senate. In the state elections, Democrats gained seven state governorships, control of at least 350 state legislative seats, and control of six state legislative chambers.\n \nThe elections marked the highest [[voter turnout]] seen in midterm elections since [[United States elections, 1914|1914]]. The elections saw several electoral firsts for women, racial minorities and [[LGBT]] candidates, including the election of the [[Jared Polis|first openly gay governor]] and the [[Kyrsten Sinema|first openly bisexual U.S. senator]]. In various referenda, numerous states voted to expand [[Medicaid]] coverage, require [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter identification]], establish independent [[redistricting commission]]s, legalize [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], repeal [[felony disenfranchisement]] laws and enact other proposals.\n\nDuring the campaign, Democrats focused on health care, frequently attacking Republicans for supporting repeal of provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also known as Obamacare), including protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Republican messaging focused on immigration and the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. There were [[Russian interference in the 2018 United States elections|allegations of attempted Russian interference in these elections]] as well as [[Voter suppression in the United States#2017\u20132018|controversies regarding potential voter suppression]] and other alleged election irregularities. The election was widely characterized as a [[Wave elections in the United States|\"blue wave\" election]] in the U.S. House and in the gubernatorial races to an extent, but not in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats suffered a net loss of two seats.\n\n== Issues, advertisements, and campaigning ==\n\nIn May 2018, President Trump began to emphasize his effort to overcome the traditional strength of the non-presidential party in midterm elections, with the \"top priority for the White House [being to hold] the Republican majority in the Senate\". He was already well into his own [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2020|2020 reelection campaign]], having launched it on his [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration day]] in January 2017.<ref>[[Jeff Zeleny|Zeleny, Jeff,]], Sarah Westwood and Pamela Brown, [https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/31/politics/midterm-trump-campaign/index.html \"Unprecedented?

Retrieved August 22, 2018.</ref> By early August, the president's midterm efforts had included rallies in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Montana and elsewhere \"reprising the style and rhetoric of his 2016 campaign\". He focused his message on the [[Presidency of Donald Trump#Economy|economy]], his proposed [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier|border wall]], the [[Trump tariffs|\"trade war\"]] with China, [[Presidency of Donald Trump#Relationship with the media|criticism of the media]], and his proposal to create the [[United States Space Force|space force]], a new branch of the military devoted to operations in space.<ref>Fritze, John, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/11/donald-trump-midterm-rally-message/905600002/ \"Trump's midterm message: Five things the president is telling voters\"], ''USA Today'', August 11, 2018.

Flensburg is the centre of the region of [[Southern Schleswig]]. After [[Kiel]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it is the third largest town in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nIn May 1945, Flensburg was the seat of the last government of [[Nazi Germany]], the so-called [[Flensburg government]] led by [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], which was in power from 1 May, the announcement of Hitler's death, for one week, until German armies surrendered and the town was occupied by Allied troops. The regime was officially dissolved on 23 May.\n\nThe nearest larger towns are [[Kiel]] ({{convert|86|km|0|abbr=off}} south) and [[Odense]] in Denmark ({{convert|92|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast).\nFlensburg's city centre lies about {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} from the Danish border.\n\nIn Germany, Flensburg is known for\n* the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (roughly: National Driver and Vehicle Register) with its ''Verkehrss\u00fcnderkartei'' (literally: \"traffic sinner card file\")<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/kabinett-beschliesst-punktereform-der-flensburger-verkehrssuenderkartei-a-872427.html Verkehrss\u00fcnderkartei in Flensburg: Bundeskabinett beschlie\u00dft Punktereform], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 12 December 2012</ref>\n* its beer ''[[Flensburger Brauerei|Flensburger Pilsener]]'', also called \"''Flens''\"\n* the centre of the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish national minority in Germany]]\n* the greeting [[Moin|Moin Moin]]\n* the large erotic mail-order companies ''[[Beate Uhse AG|Beate Uhse]]'' and ''Orion''\n* its handball team  [[SG Flensburg-Handewitt]]\n* the [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]] with its sail training ship [[Gorch Fock (1958)|''Gorch Fock'']]\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Hafen St Marien Flensburg2007.jpg|thumb|250px|Harbour of Flensburg, western shore, with the church \"Sankt Marien\" (Saint Mary)]]\nFlensburg is situated in the north of the [[States of Germany|German state]] [[Schleswig-Holstein]], on the German-Danish border. After [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]] on the island of [[Sylt]] it is Germany's northernmost town. Flensburg lies at the innermost tip of the [[Flensburg Firth]], an inlet of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Flensburg's eastern shore is part of the [[Angeln]] peninsula.\n\n===Neighbouring municipalities===\nClockwise from the northeast, beginning at the German shore of the Flensburg Firth, the following communities in [[Schleswig-Flensburg]] district and [[Denmark]]'s [[Region of Southern Denmark|Southern Denmark Region]] all border on Flensburg:\n\n[[Gl\u00fccksburg]] ([[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]-free town), [[Wees]] (Amt Langballig), [[Maasb\u00fcll]], [[H\u00fcrup]], [[Tastrup]] and [[Freienwill]] (all in Amt H\u00fcrup), [[Jarplund-Weding]], [[Handewitt]] (Amt Handewitt), [[Harrislee]] (Amt-free community) and [[Aabenraa Municipality]] on the Danish shore of the Flensburg Firth.\n\n===Constituent communities===\nThe town of Flensburg is divided into 13 communities, which themselves are further divided into 38 statistical areas.

In 1284, its town rights were confirmed and the town quickly rose to become one of the most important in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. Unlike [[Holstein]], however, Schleswig did not belong to the German [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Therefore, Flensburg was not a member of the [[Hanseatic League]], but it did maintain contacts with this important trading network.\n\nHistorians presume that there were several reasons for choosing this spot for settlement:\n*Shelter from heavy winds\n*Trade route between Holstein and North [[Jutland]] (namely the ''[[H\u00e6rvejen]]'' or ''Ochsenweg'', a name for a series of roads between hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland, possibly dating from the [[Bronze Age]])\n* The Angelnway: Trade route between [[North Frisia]] and [[Angeln]]\n*A good [[herring]] fishery\n\nHerrings, especially [[kipper]]ed, were what brought about the blossoming of the town's trade in the [[Middle Ages]]. They were sent inland and to almost every [[Europe]]an country.\n\nOn 28 October 1412, Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] died of the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]] aboard a ship in Flensburg Harbour.\n\nFrom time to time plagues such as bubonic plague, caused mainly by rat fleas ([[Xenopsylla cheopis]], a parasite found on [[brown rat]]s), \"red\" [[dysentery]] and other scourges killed a great deal of Flensburg's population. [[Leprosy|Lepers]] were strictly isolated, namely at the St.-J\u00fcrgen-Hospital (''Hellig\u00e5ndshospital'', built before 1290), which lay far outside the town's gates, where the St. J\u00fcrgen Church is nowadays. About 1500, [[syphilis]] also appeared. The church hospital \"Zum Heiligen Geist\" (\"To the Holy Ghost\") stood in Gro\u00dfe Stra\u00dfe, now Flensburg's [[pedestrian precinct]].\n\nA Flensburger's everyday life was very hard, and the old roads and paths were bad. The main streets were neither paved nor lit at night. When the streets became really bad, the citizens had to make the dung-filled streets passable with wooden pathways. Only the few upper-class houses had windows. In 1485, a great fire struck Flensburg. [[Storm tide]]s also beset the town occasionally. Every household in the town kept [[livestock]] in the house and the yard. Townsfolk furthermore had their own cowherds and a swineherd.\n\n===Early modern times===\nAfter the fall of the [[Hanseatic League]] in the 16th century, Flensburg was said to be one of the most important trading towns in the [[Scandinavia]]n area. Flensburg merchants were active as far away as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]. The most important commodities, after herring, were [[sugar]] and [[whale oil]], the latter from [[whaling]] off Greenland. However, the [[Thirty Years' War]] put an end to this boom time. The town was becoming [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and thereby ever more German culturally and linguistically, while the neighbouring countryside remained decidedly Danish.\n\nIn the 18th century, thanks to the [[rum]] trade, Flensburg had yet another boom. [[Cane sugar]] was imported from the [[Danish West Indies]] (now the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]]) and refined in Flensburg. Only in the 19th century, as a result of industrialization, was the town at last outstripped by the competition from cities such as [[Copenhagen]] and [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe rum blended in Flensburg then became a secondary industry in [[West Indies|West Indian]] trade, as of 1864 no longer with the Danish West Indies, but with [[Jamaica]], then ruled by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. It was imported from there, blended, and sold all over Europe. There is nowadays only one active rum distillery in Flensburg, \"A. H. Johannsen\".\n[[File:Flensburg_Braun-Hogenberg.jpg|thumb|250px|Flensburg, early 17th century]]\n\n===History as a German town===\nBetween 1460 and 1864, Flensburg was, after Copenhagen, the second biggest port in the Kingdom of Denmark, but it passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] after the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864. The [[Battle of Flensburg]] was on February 6, 1864: near the city a small [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] mounted regiment chased a [[Denmark|Danish]] infantry and Dragoon regiment. There is still a considerable Danish community in the town today. Some estimates put the percentage of Flensburgers who belong to it as high as 25%; other estimates put that percentage much lower. The [[South Schleswig Voter Federation|SSW]] political party representing the minority usually gains 20\u201325% of the votes in local elections, but by no means are all of its voters Danes. Before 1864, more than 50% belonged to what is now the minority, witnessed even today by the great number of Danish surnames in the Flensburg [[telephone directory]] (''Asmussen, Claussen, Jacobsen, Jensen, Petersen,'' etc.). The upper classes and the learned at that time, however, were German, and since 1864, the [[German language]] has prevailed in the town.\n\nOn 1 April 1889, Flensburg became an [[independent city]] (''kreisfreie Stadt'') within the [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]], and at the same time still kept its status as seat of the Flensburg district. In 1920, the [[League of Nations]] decided that the matter of the German-Danish [[border]] would be settled by a vote. As a result of the [[plebiscite]], and the way the voting zones were laid out, some of Flensburg's northern neighbourhoods were ceded to Denmark, whereas Flensburg as a whole voted with a great majority to stay in Germany.\n\nIn return for this great pro-German majority, the town of Flensburg was given a large hall, the \"Deutsches Haus\", which was endowed by the government as \"thanks for German loyalty\".\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the town was left almost unscathed by the air raids that devastated other German cities. However, in 1943, 20 children died when their nursery school was bombed, and shortly after the war ended, an explosion at a local munitions storage site claimed many victims.\n\n[[File:Die Sportschule Flensburg-M\u00fcrwik (Mai 2014), Bild 002.JPG|thumb|The Sportschool in [[M\u00fcrwik]], at the [[Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik]], where the seat of the Flensburg Government was found in 1945. (photo 2014)]]\nIn 1945, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who was briefly [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] (''Reichspr\u00e4sident'') of [[Nazi Germany]] once [[Adolf Hitler]] had appointed him his successor and then killed himself, fled to Flensburg with what was left of [[Flensburg government|his government]] where they were taken prisoner by British troops and deposed in [[M\u00fcrwik]] at the [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik|Navy School in M\u00fcrwik]] ({{lang-de|Marineschule M\u00fcrwik}}). Flensburg was thereby, for a few weeks, the seat of the last ''Third Reich'' government.\n\n===Since the Second World War===\nAfter the Second World War, the town's population broke the 100,000 mark for a short time, thereby making Flensburg a city (''Gro\u00dfstadt'') under one traditional definition. The population later sank below that mark, however.\n\nIn the years after the Second World War, there was in South Schleswig, and particularly in Flensburg a strong pro-Danish movement connected with the idea of the \"Eider Politics\". Their goal was for the town, and indeed all or most of Schleswig \u2013 the whole area north of the river [[Eider River|Eider]]\u2013-to be united with Denmark. In the years following 1945, Flensburg's town council was dominated by Danish parties, and the town had a Danish mayor.\n\nThe town of Flensburg profited from the planned location of military installations. Since the [[German Reunification]], the number of soldiers has dropped to about 8,000. Since Denmark's entry into the European Economic Community (now the [[European Union]]), border trade has played an important role in Flensburg's economic life. Some Danish businesses, such as [[Danfoss]], have set up shop just south of the border for tax reasons.\n\nIn 1970, the Flensburg district was expanded to include the municipalities in the Amt of Medelby, formerly in the S\u00fcdtondern district, and in 1974 it was united with the Schleswig district to form the district of Schleswig-Flensburg, whose district seat was the town of [[Schleswig (city)|Schleswig]]. Flensburg thereby lost its function as a district seat, but it remained an independent (district-free) town.\n\n===Amalgamations===\nUntil the middle of the 19th century Flensburg's municipal area comprised a total area of 2&nbsp;639&nbsp;ha. Beginning in 1874, however, the following communities or rural areas (''Gemarkungen'') were annexed to the town of Flensburg:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! Year !!

The co-existence of these two groups is considered a sound and healthy [[symbiosis]].  There is a form of mixed Danish\u2013German used on the ferries, [[Petuh]].\n\nThere is also a [[List of diplomatic missions of the Kingdom of Denmark|Danish Consulate-General]] in Flensburg.<ref>[http://tyskland.um.dk/da/om-os/danske-repraesentationer-i-tyskland/generalkonsulatet-i-flensborg Generalkonsulatet i Flensburg], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)]]</ref> \n\nIn Denmark, Flensburg seems to be mainly known for its \"border shops\" where, among other things, [[Distilled beverage|spirits]], [[beer]] and [[candy]] can be purchased at cheaper prices than in [[Denmark]]. The prices are lower because the [[value-added tax]] is lower and [[Excise|excise taxes]] are either lower (e.g. on alcohol) or do not exist (on e.g. sugar). Currently the border shops are able to sell canned beer to persons resident in Scandinavia without paying [[Container deposit legislation|deposits]] as long as the beverage is not consumed in [[Germany]].\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Significant minority groups'''\n|-\n| Nationality || Population (31.12.2018)\n|-\n|{{flag|Denmark}} || 2,490\n|-\n|{{flag|Syria}} || 2,185\n|-\n|{{flag|Romania}} || 1,435\n|-\n|{{flag|Poland}} || 995\n|-\n|{{flag|Turkey}} || 810\n|-\n|{{flag|Iraq}} || 810\n|-\n|{{flag|Afghanistan}}||765\n|-\n|}\n\n==Politics==\nThe town council was led for centuries by two mayors, one for the north town (St. Marien) and the other for the south town (St. Nikolai and St. Johannis). The council members and the mayors were chosen by the council itself, that is, retiring officials had their successors named by the remaining councillors in such a way that both halves of the town had as many members. These councillors usually bore the title \"Senator\".\n\nThis \"town government\" lasted until 1742 when the \"northern mayor\" was made the \"directing mayor\" by the Danish King. From this position came what was later known as the First Mayor. The second mayor simply bore the title \"mayor\" (\"''B\u00fcrgermeister''\"). After the town had been ceded to Prussia, the mayors were elected by the townsfolk as of 1870, and the First Mayor was given the title ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'', still the usual title in German towns and cities. During the Third Reich, the town head was appointed by those who held power locally at the time.\n\nIn 1945, after the Second World War, a twofold leadership based on a British model was introduced. Heading the town stood foremost the ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'', who was chosen by the town council and whose job was as chairman of council and the municipality. Next to him was an ''Oberstadtdirektor'' (\"Higher Town Director\") who was leader of administration. In 1950, when Schleswig-Holstein brought its new laws for municipalities into force, the title ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' was transferred (once again) to this latter official. At first, and for a while, he was chosen by the council. Since that time, the former official has been called the ''Stadtpr\u00e4sident'' (\"Town President\"), and is likewise chosen by the council after each municipal election. However, since 1999, the ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' has been chosen directly by the voters as once before.\n\nThe first directly elected ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' Hermann Stell died on 4 May 2004 of a [[stroke]]. On 14 November of the same year, the independent candidate suggested by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] Klaus Tscheuschner was elected to replace Stell with 59% of the vote. In the municipal election in 2003, Hans Hermann Laturnus was elected ''Stadtpr\u00e4sident''.\n\nIn the municipal election of 2008, the local list WiF (Wir in Flensburg) was elected largest group in the Council Assembly of Flensburg, with its 10 [[Councillor|city councillors]] out of 43, closely followed by the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] (''S\u00fcdschleswigscher W\u00e4hlerverband'') (9 councillors) and the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] (9 councillors). Also elected was the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] (seven councillors), the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] (3 councillors), [[The Left (Germany)|the Left]] (3 councillors) and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] (2 councillors).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flensburg.de/politik-verwaltung/rat-und-ausschuesse/kommunalwahl-2008/index.php |title=Stadt Flensburg \u2013 Kommunalwahl 2008 |publisher=Flensburg.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Nevertheless, since the WiF-group was divided into two different caucuses, the SSW-group has been the largest group in the Council Assembly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/top-thema/article//ssw-und-cdu-wollen-den-stadtpraesidenten-stuerzen.html |title=SSW und CDU wollen den Stadtpr\u00e4sidenten st\u00fcrzen |publisher=shz.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312153341/http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/top-thema/article//ssw-und-cdu-wollen-den-stadtpraesidenten-stuerzen.html |archive-date=2012-03-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The current City President is Dr. Christian Dewanger (WiF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flensburg.de/politik-verwaltung/rat-und-ausschuesse/stadtpraesident/index.php |title=Stadt Flensburg \u2013 Stadtpr\u00e4sident |publisher=Flensburg.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the mayoral election of 2010, Simon Faber (SSW) was elected Lord Mayor of the town in a run-off election with 54,8% of the vote.

The town's flag is blue, overlaid with the coat of arms in colour.\n\nThe lions symbolize Schleswig, and the nettle leaf Holstein, thus expressing the town's unity with these two historic lands. The tower recalls Flensburg's old town rights and the old castle that was the town's namesake (''Burg'' means \"castle\" in German). The waves refer to the town's position on the Flensburg Fjord.\n\nThe coat of arms was granted the town by [[Wilhelm II of Germany|King Wilhelm II of Prussia]] in 1901, and once again in modified, newly approved form on 19 January 1937 by Schleswig-Holstein's High President (''Oberpr\u00e4sident'')\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nFlensburg is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Stadtportrait|url=https://www.flensburg.de/Leben-Soziales/Stadtportrait|website=flensburg.de|publisher=Flensburg|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], United Kingdom\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Neubrandenburg]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[S\u0142upsk]], Poland\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n\n===Energy===\n\nThe town has a well established Combined Heat and Power and District Heating scheme which was installed between 1970 and 1980.<ref>p167.  http://setis.ec.europa.eu/publications/jrc-setis-reports/background-report-eu-27-district-heating-and-cooling-potentials</ref>\n\n===Transport===\nWest of Flensburg runs the [[Bundesautobahn 7|A 7]] Autobahn, leading north to the Danish border, whence it continues as [[European route E45]]. Furthermore, Federal Highways (''Bundesstra\u00dfen'') B&nbsp;200 and B&nbsp;199 pass through the municipal area.\n\nAlso west of the town lies the Flensburg-Sch\u00e4ferhaus [[airport]].\n\nLocal transport is provided by several [[bus]]lines such as \"Aktiv Bus GmbH\" and \"Allgemeinen Flensburger Autobus Gesellschaft\" (AFAG) along with others. They all operate within an integrated fare system within the Flensburg transport community (''Verkehrsgemeinschaft Flensburg''). They also all subscribe to the Schleswig-Holstein tariff system whereby anyone travelling from anywhere in Schleswig-Holstein or [[Hamburg]] may use Flensburg buses free to connect with their final destinations. It works both ways, of course, and a rider boarding any bus in Flensburg need only name his destination anywhere in Schleswig-Holstein or Hamburg, pay his fare, and travel all the way to that destination on the one ticket.\n\nThe current [[Flensburg station]] was opened in 1927 south of the Old Town. From there, trains run on the [[Neum\u00fcnster\u2013Flensburg railway|main line to Neum\u00fcnster]] and on to [[Hamburg]] and to [[Fredericia]], among them some [[InterCity]] connections as well as trains serving the line running to [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]] and [[Kiel]]. Another stop for regional trains to Neum\u00fcnster is to be found in Flensburg-Weiche. The stretch of line to [[Nieb\u00fcll]] has been out of service since 1981, efforts to open it again notwithstanding. The secondary line to [[Husum]] and the lesser lines to [[Kappeln]] and [[Satrup]] no longer exist. Even the [[tram]]way, which opened in 1881 to horse-drawn trams, was electrified in 1906 and at one point ran four lines was replaced with buses in 1973.\n\n===Established businesses===\n* A.H.

There are also two weekly advertising flyers, \"MoinMoin\" (named for a common regional greeting) and \"Wochenschau\" (\"Newsreel\") as well as an illustrated town paper (\"Flensburg Journal\"), the Flensburg \"campus newspaper\" and a town magazine (\"Partout\"). [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] (NDR) runs one of its oldest studios right near the Deutsches Haus. Flensburg is the site of a number of [[radio transmission]] facilities: on the [[Flensburg-Engelsby transmitter|Fuchsberg]] in the community of Engelsby, Norddeutscher Rundfunk runs a transmission facility for [[VHF]], [[television]] and [[medium wave]]. A [[cage aerial]] is mounted on a 215&nbsp;m-high guyed, earthed steel-lattice mast. This transmitter is successor to the Flensburg transmitter through which the announcement of Germany's surrender was broadcast on 8 May 1945.\n\nThe broadcasting tower on the Fuchsberg is used for the programmes of [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] and [[Danmarks Radio]] while the countrywide VHF radio programmes of R.SH, delta radio, [[Deutschlandfunk]] and [[Deutschlandradio]] are aired from the Flensburg-Freienwill tower.\n\nFlensburg has no local transmitter of its own because Schleswig-Holstein's state broadcasting laws only allow transmitters that broadcast statewide. From 1993 to 1996, \"Radio Flensburg\" tried to establish a local Flensburg radio station by using a local transmitter just across the border in Denmark. It had to be shut down, however, owing to the Danish transmitter's own financial problems. From October 2006 Radio Flensburg broadcast as an [[internet radio]].\n\nThe \"Offener Kanal\" (\"Open Channel\") shows programmes made by local citizens seven days a week, mostly in the evenings, and can also be seen on cable television.\n\n===Public institutions===\nFlensburg is home to the following institutions:\n*Handwerkskammer Flensburg (Chamber of Skilled Crafts)\n*IHK Flensburg (Chamber of Trade and Industry)\n*Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (federal government office for road traffic)\n\n===Education===\n* '''[[University of Flensburg]]''' with about 4,000 students; founded in 1946 as a Pedagogical College, raised to [[university]] in 1994. Unlike the much larger [[University of Kiel]] it is not a full university \u2013 [[theology]], [[medicine]], [[law]] and some other programs are not offered here. The college does, however, have the right to confer doctorates.\n* '''[[Fachhochschule Flensburg]]''', a [[Fachhochschule]] with more than 3,000 students; in 1886 a royal steamship machinist school was established, out of which developed a ship's engineers' school. From this grew the Fachhochschule for Technology, which was converted into the current Fachhochschule Flensburg in 1973, at which time the [[economics]] programme was also introduced.\n* '''Marineschule M\u00fcrwik''' ([[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]]), main educational establishment for all [[German Navy]] officers.\n* '''Flensburger Volkshochschule''' (German [[Folk high school]])\n* '''Voksenundervisningen''' (Danish)\n\nAlso on hand in Flensburg is a complete range of training and professional schools, including a number of Danish ones. Flensburg is home to Schleswig-Holstein's Central State Library, a university library, a town bookshop and the Danish Central Library for South Schleswig. The last named offers not only intensive courses in Danish, but also, with its \"Slesvigsk samling\" collection, a vast repository of unique material about the border area's history and culture. Flensburg has an extensive town archive. The Danish minority's archive is housed at the Danish Central Library.\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n[[File:Marine-Burg (Flensburg 2014).JPG|thumb|The [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]], a late castle building which is still in use]]\n[[File:Gorch Fock II liegt an der Pier vor der Marineschule M\u00fcrwik (Flensburg).jpg|thumb|The [[Gorch Fock (1958)|Gorch Fock]] on the port of the [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]]]]\n\n===Theatre===\n* ''[[Schleswig-Holstein]]isches Landestheater'' (at the ''Stadttheater'') and Symphony Orchestra\n* ''Niederdeutsche B\u00fchne der Stadt Flensburg'' (\"Low German Stage of the city of Flensburg\")\n* ''Det Lille Teater'' (Danish theatre)\n* ''Theaterwerkstatt Pilkentafel'' (Theatre Workshop)\n* ''Orpheus-Theater''\n\n===Archives and libraries===\n* Town Archive, a very comprehensive collection, at the town hall\n* ''Dansk Centralbibliotek for Sydslesvig'', with archive of the Danish minority and Schleswig book collection\n* Town Library\n* State Central Library and ''Zentrale Hochschulbibliothek'' (Central College Library)\n\n===Museums===\n* ''[[Museumsberg Flensburg|Museumsberg]]'' \u2013 Museum for artistic and cultural history.\n* ''Schifffahrtsmuseum'' \u2013 Museum for shipping and shipbuilding.\n* ''Rummuseum'' \u2013 History of the \"Rum Town\" of Flensburg.\n* ''Naturwissenschaftliches Museum'' \u2013 Animal and plant worlds of northern Schleswig-Holstein.\n* ''[[Museumshafen Flensburg|Museumshafen]]'' \u2013 Private initiative for maintaining old traditional working boats mainly from the Baltics (Segelschiffe).\n* ''Museumswerft'' \u2013 Shipbuilding (sail) of bygone centuries.

Characteristic is the row along the waterfront. Three of the four old town cores are found along this north-south axis. The building boom in Imperial times led to a partial rebuilding of the Old Town, but without destroying its structure, and rather leading to notable expansion of the town. Virtually unscathed in the Second World War, Flensburg, like other places in Germany, adopted a policy of getting rid of old buildings and building anew in the style of the times. This trend was limited in Flensburg by a lack of money, but before the policy was finally stopped in the late 1970s, countless old buildings had been demolished in the north and east Old Town to be replaced by newer structures. Despite great losses, Flensburg still comes across as having a compact, well preserved Old Town in the valley with good additions to what was built in the founders' time on the surrounding heights.\n\n*[[Johanniskirche (Flensburg)|Johanniskirche]] (''Johannischurch''), town's oldest church in the innertown, 12th century\n*[[Marienkirche (Flensburg)|Marienkirche]], High [[Gothic

''Flansborj''; [[South Jutlandic]]: ''Flensborre'') is an [[independent city|independent town]] (''kreisfreie Stadt'') in the north of the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Flensburg is the centre of the region of [[Southern Schleswig]]. After [[Kiel]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it is the third largest town in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nIn May 1945, Flensburg was the seat of the last government of [[Nazi Germany]], the so-called [[Flensburg government]] led by [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], which was in power from 1 May, the announcement of Hitler's death, for one week, until German armies surrendered and the town was occupied by Allied troops. The regime was officially dissolved on 23 May.\n\nThe nearest larger towns are [[Kiel]] ({{convert|86|km|0|abbr=off}} south) and [[Odense]] in Denmark ({{convert|92|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast).\nFlensburg's city centre lies about {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} from the Danish border.\n\nIn Germany, Flensburg is known for\n* the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (roughly: National Driver and Vehicle Register) with its ''Verkehrss\u00fcnderkartei'' (literally: \"traffic sinner card file\")<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/kabinett-beschliesst-punktereform-der-flensburger-verkehrssuenderkartei-a-872427.html Verkehrss\u00fcnderkartei in Flensburg: Bundeskabinett beschlie\u00dft Punktereform], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 12 December 2012</ref>\n* its beer ''[[Flensburger Brauerei|Flensburger Pilsener]]'', also called \"''Flens''\"\n* the centre of the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish national minority in Germany]]\n* the greeting [[Moin|Moin Moin]]\n* the large erotic mail-order companies ''[[Beate Uhse AG|Beate Uhse]]'' and ''Orion''\n* its handball team  [[SG Flensburg-Handewitt]]\n* the [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]] with its sail training ship [[Gorch Fock (1958)|''Gorch Fock'']]\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Hafen St Marien Flensburg2007.jpg|thumb|250px|Harbour of Flensburg, western shore, with the church \"Sankt Marien\" (Saint Mary)]]\nFlensburg is situated in the north of the [[States of Germany|German state]] [[Schleswig-Holstein]], on the German-Danish border. After [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]] on the island of [[Sylt]] it is Germany's northernmost town. Flensburg lies at the innermost tip of the [[Flensburg Firth]], an inlet of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Flensburg's eastern shore is part of the [[Angeln]] peninsula.\n\n===Neighbouring municipalities===\nClockwise from the northeast, beginning at the German shore of the Flensburg Firth, the following communities in [[Schleswig-Flensburg]] district and [[Denmark]]'s [[Region of Southern Denmark|Southern Denmark Region]] all border on Flensburg:\n\n[[Gl\u00fccksburg]] ([[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]-free town), [[Wees]] (Amt Langballig), [[Maasb\u00fcll]], [[H\u00fcrup]], [[Tastrup]] and [[Freienwill]] (all in Amt H\u00fcrup), [[Jarplund-Weding]], [[Handewitt]] (Amt Handewitt), [[Harrislee]] (Amt-free community) and [[Aabenraa Municipality]] on the Danish shore of the Flensburg Firth.\n\n===Constituent communities===\nThe town of Flensburg is divided into 13 communities, which themselves are further divided into 38 statistical areas.

In 1284, its town rights were confirmed and the town quickly rose to become one of the most important in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. Unlike [[Holstein]], however, Schleswig did not belong to the German [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Therefore, Flensburg was not a member of the [[Hanseatic League]], but it did maintain contacts with this important trading network.\n\nHistorians presume that there were several reasons for choosing this spot for settlement:\n*Shelter from heavy winds\n*Trade route between Holstein and North [[Jutland]] (namely the ''[[H\u00e6rvejen]]'' or ''Ochsenweg'', a name for a series of roads between hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland, possibly dating from the [[Bronze Age]])\n* The Angelnway: Trade route between [[North Frisia]] and [[Angeln]]\n*A good [[herring]] fishery\n\nHerrings, especially [[kipper]]ed, were what brought about the blossoming of the town's trade in the [[Middle Ages]]. They were sent inland and to almost every [[Europe]]an country.\n\nOn 28 October 1412, Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] died of the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]] aboard a ship in Flensburg Harbour.\n\nFrom time to time plagues such as bubonic plague, caused mainly by rat fleas ([[Xenopsylla cheopis]], a parasite found on [[brown rat]]s), \"red\" [[dysentery]] and other scourges killed a great deal of Flensburg's population. [[Leprosy|Lepers]] were strictly isolated, namely at the St.-J\u00fcrgen-Hospital (''Hellig\u00e5ndshospital'', built before 1290), which lay far outside the town's gates, where the St. J\u00fcrgen Church is nowadays. About 1500, [[syphilis]] also appeared. The church hospital \"Zum Heiligen Geist\" (\"To the Holy Ghost\") stood in Gro\u00dfe Stra\u00dfe, now Flensburg's [[pedestrian precinct]].\n\nA Flensburger's everyday life was very hard, and the old roads and paths were bad. The main streets were neither paved nor lit at night. When the streets became really bad, the citizens had to make the dung-filled streets passable with wooden pathways. Only the few upper-class houses had windows. In 1485, a great fire struck Flensburg. [[Storm tide]]s also beset the town occasionally. Every household in the town kept [[livestock]] in the house and the yard. Townsfolk furthermore had their own cowherds and a swineherd.\n\n===Early modern times===\nAfter the fall of the [[Hanseatic League]] in the 16th century, Flensburg was said to be one of the most important trading towns in the [[Scandinavia]]n area. Flensburg merchants were active as far away as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]. The most important commodities, after herring, were [[sugar]] and [[whale oil]], the latter from [[whaling]] off Greenland. However, the [[Thirty Years' War]] put an end to this boom time. The town was becoming [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and thereby ever more German culturally and linguistically, while the neighbouring countryside remained decidedly Danish.\n\nIn the 18th century, thanks to the [[rum]] trade, Flensburg had yet another boom. [[Cane sugar]] was imported from the [[Danish West Indies]] (now the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]]) and refined in Flensburg. Only in the 19th century, as a result of industrialization, was the town at last outstripped by the competition from cities such as [[Copenhagen]] and [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe rum blended in Flensburg then became a secondary industry in [[West Indies|West Indian]] trade, as of 1864 no longer with the Danish West Indies, but with [[Jamaica]], then ruled by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. It was imported from there, blended, and sold all over Europe. There is nowadays only one active rum distillery in Flensburg, \"A. H. Johannsen\".\n[[File:Flensburg_Braun-Hogenberg.jpg|thumb|250px|Flensburg, early 17th century]]\n\n===History as a German town===\nBetween 1460 and 1864, Flensburg was, after Copenhagen, the second biggest port in the Kingdom of Denmark, but it passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] after the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864. The [[Battle of Flensburg]] was on February 6, 1864: near the city a small [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] mounted regiment chased a [[Denmark|Danish]] infantry and Dragoon regiment. There is still a considerable Danish community in the town today. Some estimates put the percentage of Flensburgers who belong to it as high as 25%; other estimates put that percentage much lower. The [[South Schleswig Voter Federation|SSW]] political party representing the minority usually gains 20\u201325% of the votes in local elections, but by no means are all of its voters Danes. Before 1864, more than 50% belonged to what is now the minority, witnessed even today by the great number of Danish surnames in the Flensburg [[telephone directory]] (''Asmussen, Claussen, Jacobsen, Jensen, Petersen,'' etc.). The upper classes and the learned at that time, however, were German, and since 1864, the [[German language]] has prevailed in the town.\n\nOn 1 April 1889, Flensburg became an [[independent city]] (''kreisfreie Stadt'') within the [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]], and at the same time still kept its status as seat of the Flensburg district. In 1920, the [[League of Nations]] decided that the matter of the German-Danish [[border]] would be settled by a vote. As a result of the [[plebiscite]], and the way the voting zones were laid out, some of Flensburg's northern neighbourhoods were ceded to Denmark, whereas Flensburg as a whole voted with a great majority to stay in Germany.\n\nIn return for this great pro-German majority, the town of Flensburg was given a large hall, the \"Deutsches Haus\", which was endowed by the government as \"thanks for German loyalty\".\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the town was left almost unscathed by the air raids that devastated other German cities. However, in 1943, 20 children died when their nursery school was bombed, and shortly after the war ended, an explosion at a local munitions storage site claimed many victims.\n\n[[File:Die Sportschule Flensburg-M\u00fcrwik (Mai 2014), Bild 002.JPG|thumb|The Sportschool in [[M\u00fcrwik]], at the [[Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik]], where the seat of the Flensburg Government was found in 1945. (photo 2014)]]\nIn 1945, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who was briefly [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] (''Reichspr\u00e4sident'') of [[Nazi Germany]] once [[Adolf Hitler]] had appointed him his successor and then killed himself, fled to Flensburg with what was left of [[Flensburg government|his government]] where they were taken prisoner by British troops and deposed in [[M\u00fcrwik]] at the [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik|Navy School in M\u00fcrwik]] ({{lang-de|Marineschule M\u00fcrwik}}). Flensburg was thereby, for a few weeks, the seat of the last ''Third Reich'' government.\n\n===Since the Second World War===\nAfter the Second World War, the town's population broke the 100,000 mark for a short time, thereby making Flensburg a city (''Gro\u00dfstadt'') under one traditional definition. The population later sank below that mark, however.\n\nIn the years after the Second World War, there was in South Schleswig, and particularly in Flensburg a strong pro-Danish movement connected with the idea of the \"Eider Politics\". Their goal was for the town, and indeed all or most of Schleswig \u2013 the whole area north of the river [[Eider River|Eider]]\u2013-to be united with Denmark. In the years following 1945, Flensburg's town council was dominated by Danish parties, and the town had a Danish mayor.\n\nThe town of Flensburg profited from the planned location of military installations. Since the [[German Reunification]], the number of soldiers has dropped to about 8,000. Since Denmark's entry into the European Economic Community (now the [[European Union]]), border trade has played an important role in Flensburg's economic life. Some Danish businesses, such as [[Danfoss]], have set up shop just south of the border for tax reasons.\n\nIn 1970, the Flensburg district was expanded to include the municipalities in the Amt of Medelby, formerly in the S\u00fcdtondern district, and in 1974 it was united with the Schleswig district to form the district of Schleswig-Flensburg, whose district seat was the town of [[Schleswig (city)|Schleswig]]. Flensburg thereby lost its function as a district seat, but it remained an independent (district-free) town.\n\n===Amalgamations===\nUntil the middle of the 19th century Flensburg's municipal area comprised a total area of 2&nbsp;639&nbsp;ha. Beginning in 1874, however, the following communities or rural areas (''Gemarkungen'') were annexed to the town of Flensburg:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! Year !!

The co-existence of these two groups is considered a sound and healthy [[symbiosis]].  There is a form of mixed Danish\u2013German used on the ferries, [[Petuh]].\n\nThere is also a [[List of diplomatic missions of the Kingdom of Denmark|Danish Consulate-General]] in Flensburg.<ref>[http://tyskland.um.dk/da/om-os/danske-repraesentationer-i-tyskland/generalkonsulatet-i-flensborg Generalkonsulatet i Flensburg], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)]]</ref> \n\nIn Denmark, Flensburg seems to be mainly known for its \"border shops\" where, among other things, [[Distilled beverage|spirits]], [[beer]] and [[candy]] can be purchased at cheaper prices than in [[Denmark]]. The prices are lower because the [[value-added tax]] is lower and [[Excise|excise taxes]] are either lower (e.g. on alcohol) or do not exist (on e.g. sugar). Currently the border shops are able to sell canned beer to persons resident in Scandinavia without paying [[Container deposit legislation|deposits]] as long as the beverage is not consumed in [[Germany]].\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Significant minority groups'''\n|-\n| Nationality || Population (31.12.2018)\n|-\n|{{flag|Denmark}} || 2,490\n|-\n|{{flag|Syria}} || 2,185\n|-\n|{{flag|Romania}} || 1,435\n|-\n|{{flag|Poland}} || 995\n|-\n|{{flag|Turkey}} || 810\n|-\n|{{flag|Iraq}} || 810\n|-\n|{{flag|Afghanistan}}||765\n|-\n|}\n\n==Politics==\nThe town council was led for centuries by two mayors, one for the north town (St. Marien) and the other for the south town (St. Nikolai and St. Johannis). The council members and the mayors were chosen by the council itself, that is, retiring officials had their successors named by the remaining councillors in such a way that both halves of the town had as many members. These councillors usually bore the title \"Senator\".\n\nThis \"town government\" lasted until 1742 when the \"northern mayor\" was made the \"directing mayor\" by the Danish King. From this position came what was later known as the First Mayor. The second mayor simply bore the title \"mayor\" (\"''B\u00fcrgermeister''\"). After the town had been ceded to Prussia, the mayors were elected by the townsfolk as of 1870, and the First Mayor was given the title ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'', still the usual title in German towns and cities. During the Third Reich, the town head was appointed by those who held power locally at the time.\n\nIn 1945, after the Second World War, a twofold leadership based on a British model was introduced. Heading the town stood foremost the ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'', who was chosen by the town council and whose job was as chairman of council and the municipality. Next to him was an ''Oberstadtdirektor'' (\"Higher Town Director\") who was leader of administration. In 1950, when Schleswig-Holstein brought its new laws for municipalities into force, the title ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' was transferred (once again) to this latter official. At first, and for a while, he was chosen by the council. Since that time, the former official has been called the ''Stadtpr\u00e4sident'' (\"Town President\"), and is likewise chosen by the council after each municipal election. However, since 1999, the ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' has been chosen directly by the voters as once before.\n\nThe first directly elected ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' Hermann Stell died on 4 May 2004 of a [[stroke]]. On 14 November of the same year, the independent candidate suggested by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] Klaus Tscheuschner was elected to replace Stell with 59% of the vote. In the municipal election in 2003, Hans Hermann Laturnus was elected ''Stadtpr\u00e4sident''.\n\nIn the municipal election of 2008, the local list WiF (Wir in Flensburg) was elected largest group in the Council Assembly of Flensburg, with its 10 [[Councillor|city councillors]] out of 43, closely followed by the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] (''S\u00fcdschleswigscher W\u00e4hlerverband'') (9 councillors) and the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] (9 councillors). Also elected was the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] (seven councillors), the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] (3 councillors), [[The Left (Germany)|the Left]] (3 councillors) and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] (2 councillors).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flensburg.de/politik-verwaltung/rat-und-ausschuesse/kommunalwahl-2008/index.php |title=Stadt Flensburg \u2013 Kommunalwahl 2008 |publisher=Flensburg.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Nevertheless, since the WiF-group was divided into two different caucuses, the SSW-group has been the largest group in the Council Assembly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/top-thema/article//ssw-und-cdu-wollen-den-stadtpraesidenten-stuerzen.html |title=SSW und CDU wollen den Stadtpr\u00e4sidenten st\u00fcrzen |publisher=shz.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312153341/http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/top-thema/article//ssw-und-cdu-wollen-den-stadtpraesidenten-stuerzen.html |archive-date=2012-03-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The current City President is Dr. Christian Dewanger (WiF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flensburg.de/politik-verwaltung/rat-und-ausschuesse/stadtpraesident/index.php |title=Stadt Flensburg \u2013 Stadtpr\u00e4sident |publisher=Flensburg.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the mayoral election of 2010, Simon Faber (SSW) was elected Lord Mayor of the town in a run-off election with 54,8% of the vote.

The town's flag is blue, overlaid with the coat of arms in colour.\n\nThe lions symbolize Schleswig, and the nettle leaf Holstein, thus expressing the town's unity with these two historic lands. The tower recalls Flensburg's old town rights and the old castle that was the town's namesake (''Burg'' means \"castle\" in German). The waves refer to the town's position on the Flensburg Fjord.\n\nThe coat of arms was granted the town by [[Wilhelm II of Germany|King Wilhelm II of Prussia]] in 1901, and once again in modified, newly approved form on 19 January 1937 by Schleswig-Holstein's High President (''Oberpr\u00e4sident'')\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nFlensburg is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Stadtportrait|url=https://www.flensburg.de/Leben-Soziales/Stadtportrait|website=flensburg.de|publisher=Flensburg|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], United Kingdom\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Neubrandenburg]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[S\u0142upsk]], Poland\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n\n===Energy===\n\nThe town has a well established Combined Heat and Power and District Heating scheme which was installed between 1970 and 1980.<ref>p167.  http://setis.ec.europa.eu/publications/jrc-setis-reports/background-report-eu-27-district-heating-and-cooling-potentials</ref>\n\n===Transport===\nWest of Flensburg runs the [[Bundesautobahn 7|A 7]] Autobahn, leading north to the Danish border, whence it continues as [[European route E45]]. Furthermore, Federal Highways (''Bundesstra\u00dfen'') B&nbsp;200 and B&nbsp;199 pass through the municipal area.\n\nAlso west of the town lies the Flensburg-Sch\u00e4ferhaus [[airport]].\n\nLocal transport is provided by several [[bus]]lines such as \"Aktiv Bus GmbH\" and \"Allgemeinen Flensburger Autobus Gesellschaft\" (AFAG) along with others. They all operate within an integrated fare system within the Flensburg transport community (''Verkehrsgemeinschaft Flensburg''). They also all subscribe to the Schleswig-Holstein tariff system whereby anyone travelling from anywhere in Schleswig-Holstein or [[Hamburg]] may use Flensburg buses free to connect with their final destinations. It works both ways, of course, and a rider boarding any bus in Flensburg need only name his destination anywhere in Schleswig-Holstein or Hamburg, pay his fare, and travel all the way to that destination on the one ticket.\n\nThe current [[Flensburg station]] was opened in 1927 south of the Old Town. From there, trains run on the [[Neum\u00fcnster\u2013Flensburg railway|main line to Neum\u00fcnster]] and on to [[Hamburg]] and to [[Fredericia]], among them some [[InterCity]] connections as well as trains serving the line running to [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]] and [[Kiel]]. Another stop for regional trains to Neum\u00fcnster is to be found in Flensburg-Weiche. The stretch of line to [[Nieb\u00fcll]] has been out of service since 1981, efforts to open it again notwithstanding. The secondary line to [[Husum]] and the lesser lines to [[Kappeln]] and [[Satrup]] no longer exist. Even the [[tram]]way, which opened in 1881 to horse-drawn trams, was electrified in 1906 and at one point ran four lines was replaced with buses in 1973.\n\n===Established businesses===\n* A.H.

There are also two weekly advertising flyers, \"MoinMoin\" (named for a common regional greeting) and \"Wochenschau\" (\"Newsreel\") as well as an illustrated town paper (\"Flensburg Journal\"), the Flensburg \"campus newspaper\" and a town magazine (\"Partout\"). [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] (NDR) runs one of its oldest studios right near the Deutsches Haus. Flensburg is the site of a number of [[radio transmission]] facilities: on the [[Flensburg-Engelsby transmitter|Fuchsberg]] in the community of Engelsby, Norddeutscher Rundfunk runs a transmission facility for [[VHF]], [[television]] and [[medium wave]]. A [[cage aerial]] is mounted on a 215&nbsp;m-high guyed, earthed steel-lattice mast. This transmitter is successor to the Flensburg transmitter through which the announcement of Germany's surrender was broadcast on 8 May 1945.\n\nThe broadcasting tower on the Fuchsberg is used for the programmes of [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] and [[Danmarks Radio]] while the countrywide VHF radio programmes of R.SH, delta radio, [[Deutschlandfunk]] and [[Deutschlandradio]] are aired from the Flensburg-Freienwill tower.\n\nFlensburg has no local transmitter of its own because Schleswig-Holstein's state broadcasting laws only allow transmitters that broadcast statewide. From 1993 to 1996, \"Radio Flensburg\" tried to establish a local Flensburg radio station by using a local transmitter just across the border in Denmark. It had to be shut down, however, owing to the Danish transmitter's own financial problems. From October 2006 Radio Flensburg broadcast as an [[internet radio]].\n\nThe \"Offener Kanal\" (\"Open Channel\") shows programmes made by local citizens seven days a week, mostly in the evenings, and can also be seen on cable television.\n\n===Public institutions===\nFlensburg is home to the following institutions:\n*Handwerkskammer Flensburg (Chamber of Skilled Crafts)\n*IHK Flensburg (Chamber of Trade and Industry)\n*Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (federal government office for road traffic)\n\n===Education===\n* '''[[University of Flensburg]]''' with about 4,000 students; founded in 1946 as a Pedagogical College, raised to [[university]] in 1994. Unlike the much larger [[University of Kiel]] it is not a full university \u2013 [[theology]], [[medicine]], [[law]] and some other programs are not offered here. The college does, however, have the right to confer doctorates.\n* '''[[Fachhochschule Flensburg]]''', a [[Fachhochschule]] with more than 3,000 students; in 1886 a royal steamship machinist school was established, out of which developed a ship's engineers' school. From this grew the Fachhochschule for Technology, which was converted into the current Fachhochschule Flensburg in 1973, at which time the [[economics]] programme was also introduced.\n* '''Marineschule M\u00fcrwik''' ([[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]]), main educational establishment for all [[German Navy]] officers.\n* '''Flensburger Volkshochschule''' (German [[Folk high school]])\n* '''Voksenundervisningen''' (Danish)\n\nAlso on hand in Flensburg is a complete range of training and professional schools, including a number of Danish ones. Flensburg is home to Schleswig-Holstein's Central State Library, a university library, a town bookshop and the Danish Central Library for South Schleswig. The last named offers not only intensive courses in Danish, but also, with its \"Slesvigsk samling\" collection, a vast repository of unique material about the border area's history and culture. Flensburg has an extensive town archive. The Danish minority's archive is housed at the Danish Central Library.\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n[[File:Marine-Burg (Flensburg 2014).JPG|thumb|The [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]], a late castle building which is still in use]]\n[[File:Gorch Fock II liegt an der Pier vor der Marineschule M\u00fcrwik (Flensburg).jpg|thumb|The [[Gorch Fock (1958)|Gorch Fock]] on the port of the [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]]]]\n\n===Theatre===\n* ''[[Schleswig-Holstein]]isches Landestheater'' (at the ''Stadttheater'') and Symphony Orchestra\n* ''Niederdeutsche B\u00fchne der Stadt Flensburg'' (\"Low German Stage of the city of Flensburg\")\n* ''Det Lille Teater'' (Danish theatre)\n* ''Theaterwerkstatt Pilkentafel'' (Theatre Workshop)\n* ''Orpheus-Theater''\n\n===Archives and libraries===\n* Town Archive, a very comprehensive collection, at the town hall\n* ''Dansk Centralbibliotek for Sydslesvig'', with archive of the Danish minority and Schleswig book collection\n* Town Library\n* State Central Library and ''Zentrale Hochschulbibliothek'' (Central College Library)\n\n===Museums===\n* ''[[Museumsberg Flensburg|Museumsberg]]'' \u2013 Museum for artistic and cultural history.\n* ''Schifffahrtsmuseum'' \u2013 Museum for shipping and shipbuilding.\n* ''Rummuseum'' \u2013 History of the \"Rum Town\" of Flensburg.\n* ''Naturwissenschaftliches Museum'' \u2013 Animal and plant worlds of northern Schleswig-Holstein.\n* ''[[Museumshafen Flensburg|Museumshafen]]'' \u2013 Private initiative for maintaining old traditional working boats mainly from the Baltics (Segelschiffe).\n* ''Museumswerft'' \u2013 Shipbuilding (sail) of bygone centuries.

Characteristic is the row along the waterfront. Three of the four old town cores are found along this north-south axis. The building boom in Imperial times led to a partial rebuilding of the Old Town, but without destroying its structure, and rather leading to notable expansion of the town. Virtually unscathed in the Second World War, Flensburg, like other places in Germany, adopted a policy of getting rid of old buildings and building anew in the style of the times. This trend was limited in Flensburg by a lack of money, but before the policy was finally stopped in the late 1970s, countless old buildings had been demolished in the north and east Old Town to be replaced by newer structures. Despite great losses, Flensburg still comes across as having a compact, well preserved Old Town in the valley with good additions to what was built in the founders' time on the surrounding heights.\n\n*[[Johanniskirche (Flensburg)|Johanniskirche]] (''Johannischurch''), town's oldest church in the innertown, 12th century\n*[[Marienkirche (Flensburg)|Marienkirche]], High [[Gothic
