Episodes like ''There Goes a [[Garbage truck|Garbage Truck]]'', ''There Goes [[Mail truck|the Mail]]'' and ''There Goes a Rescue Vehicle'', were released as a part of the '''''Dream Big''''' series. Each episode focuses on different transportation vehicles, however, one episode is reserved for [[Santa Claus]], and another for [[roller coasters]]. Each is live-action, starring [[Dave Hood]], and is sometimes accompanied by Becky Borg. Dave Hood does not appear in ''There Goes a [[Farm truck|Farm Truck]]'', ''There Goes a [[Tractor]]'', and ''There Goes a [[Dump truck|Dump Truck]]'' where he was substituted by David Sidoni.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series of videos revolved around Dave (and sometimes with Becky) in jobs that center around the vehicles being featured. Dave and Becky always reminded kids that they did not have respective jobs, but the real workers had agreed for them to pretend for the day so that the viewers could learn about the vehicles being featured as well as learn a little more about the jobs the vehicles serve. While the most part of the videos focused on showing how the vehicles worked and what they can do, in some episodes predictably Dave would get into the trope of getting in trouble (example: accidentally knocking down a building in There Goes a Bulldozer) and deliver his catchphrase, \"I shouldn't have done that!\". Sometimes, Becky would get into the same crazy trouble with Dave.\n\nIn these videos, the hosts talked about how the vehicles worked, the history of the vehicle featured and talked to real people who worked in their fields. At the end of each episode, Dave (and sometimes with Becky) would encourage the viewers to visit their local library or visit the place based on the theme's episode to learn more about the vehicles. On other episodes, at the end, Dave and Becky would also remind the viewers about safety (examples include: don't play on the railroad tracks in There Goes a Train and don't play with fire in There Goes a Fire Truck). Other times, the people who worked in the fields of the vehicles would discuss safety to the viewers as well.\n\n==Locations==\n\nThe majority of the episodes take place in California at locations such as [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]], [[Ontario International Airport]], the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]], [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] and [[Camp Pendleton]]. Occasionally, they visited places like the [[Kennedy Space Center]], the [[Pacific Southwest Railway Museum]] and the [[USS Kitty Hawk]].\n\n==List of episodes==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! # !!

Part of the [[Central Volcanic Zone]] of the Andes, it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of {{convert|4670|m}} in a depression. The caldera is associated with a less well defined caldera to the south and several [[lava dome]]s.\n\nThe caldera has been active for the last eight million years and eruptions have created several [[ignimbrite]]s. A recent eruption occurred 73,000 years ago and formed the Campo de la Piedra P\u00f3mez ignimbrite layer. About 2,300 \u00b1 160 BCE,<ref name=GVP /> the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes with a [[volcanic explosivity index|VEI]] 7 occurred at Cerro Blanco, forming the most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers. Over {{convert|170|km3}} of [[tephra]] were erupted then. The volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity. A major future eruption would put local communities to the south at risk.\n\nThe volcano is also known for giant [[ripple marks]] that have formed on its ignimbrite fields. Persistent wind action on the ground has shifted gravel and sand, forming wave-like structures. These ripple marks have heights up to {{convert|1|m}} and are separated by distances up to {{convert|30|m}}. Unlike [[dune]]s, they do not migrate with the wind and are stationary. These ripple marks are among the most extreme on Earth and have been compared to [[Mars|Martian]] ripple marks by geologists.\n\n== Geography and geomorphology ==\n\nThe caldera lies at the southern margin of the Argentine [[Altiplano|Puna]]{{efn|The [[Altiplano]]-Puna is the second-largest [[high plateau]] on Earth after the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and consists of a number of [[mountain range]]s separated by valleys with [[closed drainage]].{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=138}} }},{{sfn|Kay|Coira|Mpodozis|2006|p=499}} on the border between the [[Antofagasta de la Sierra Department]] and the [[Tinogasta Department]]{{sfn|Ratto|Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez|Basile|P\u00e9rez Torrado|2018|p=76}} in the [[Catamarca Province]] of Argentina.{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|p=3}} [[Trail]]s run through the area,{{sfn|Milana|2009|p=343}} and there are abandoned [[mining]] operations.{{sfn|Milana|2009|p=344}} [[Provincial Route 34 (Catamarca)]] between [[Fiambal\u00e1]] and [[Antofagasta de la Sierra]] runs past Cerro Blanco.{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=140}} The volcano is sometimes known as Cerro Blanco and sometimes as Robledo,{{sfn|Pritchard|Simons|2004|p=10}} with the latter name used by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].{{sfn|Brunori|Bignami|Stramondo|Bustos|2013|p=279}}\n\n=== Calderas and lava domes ===\n\nCerro Blanco lies at an elevation of {{convert|3500|-|4700|m}} and consists of four nested calderas{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|pp=4-5}} with discontinuous borders,{{sfn|Seggiaro|Hongn|Castillo|Pereyra|2006|p=27}} fallout deposits, [[lava dome]]s{{sfn|Brunori|Bignami|Stramondo|Bustos|2013|p=281}} and [[pyroclastic]] deposits.{{sfn|Chiodi|Tassi|B\u00e1ez|Filipovich|2019|p=2}} The two inconspicuous El Ni\u00f1o and Pie de San Buenaventura calderas are nested in the northern part of the complex{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|pp=4-5}} and form a {{convert|15|km}} wide depression.{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=140}} Only their northern margins are recognizable in satellite images; their southern parts are filled with [[block and ash flow]]s from the southern calderas.

Part of the [[Central Volcanic Zone]] of the Andes, it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of {{convert|4670|m}} in a depression. The caldera is associated with a less well defined caldera to the south and several [[lava dome]]s.\n\nThe caldera has been active for the last eight million years and eruptions have created several [[ignimbrite]]s. A recent eruption occurred 73,000 years ago and formed the Campo de la Piedra P\u00f3mez ignimbrite layer. About 2,300 \u00b1 160 BCE,<ref name=GVP /> the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes with a [[volcanic explosivity index|VEI]] 7 occurred at Cerro Blanco, forming the most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers. Over {{convert|170|km3}} of [[tephra]] were erupted then. The volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity. A major future eruption would put local communities to the south at risk.\n\nThe volcano is also known for giant [[ripple marks]] that have formed on its ignimbrite fields. Persistent wind action on the ground has shifted gravel and sand, forming wave-like structures.

The contention that Burns borrowed the melody from Shield is for various reasons highly unlikely, although they may very well both have taken it from a common source, possibly a [[strathspey (dance)|strathspey]] called \"The Miller's Wedding\" or \"The Miller's Daughter\".<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.themorgan.org/collection/Auld-Lang-Syne/4 |title = A Caledonian country dance |publisher =[[Morgan Library & Museum]]|date =  |access-date = 19 May 2019 }}</ref> The problem is that tunes based on the same set of dance steps necessarily have a similar rhythm, and even a superficial resemblance in melodic shape may cause a very strong apparent similarity in the tune as a whole. For instance, Burns' poem \"[[Comin' Thro' the Rye]]\" is sung to a tune that might also be based on the \"Miller's Wedding\". The origin of the tune of \"[[God Save the Queen]]\" presents a very similar problem and for just the same reason, as it is also based on a dance measure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scholes|first=Percy A.|authorlink=Percy Scholes|title=[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]|edition=Tenth|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= }}</ref> (See [[William Shield#The \"Auld Lang Syne\" controversy|the note in the William Shield article]] on this subject.)\n\n[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] wrote an arrangement of Auld Lang Syne ([[WoO]] 156/11) in the original brisk strathspey rhythm, published as part of his ''12 Scottish Folksongs'' (1814).\n\nIn 1855, different words were written for the Auld Lang Syne tune by Albert Laighton and titled, \"Song of the Old Folks\".

Depending on whether an \"official\" performance is planned it may not be listed on the programme but in this case the audience will maintain the tradition and sing it themselves, with or without backup from the performers.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n*The song is played at the Passing Out Parade of Young Officers in the [[Royal Navy]] as they march up the steps of the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]]; for Royal Air Force officers at [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell]], and at the Sovereign's Parade at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] for young officers joining the [[British Army]], as the cadets march up the steps of their famous Old College building \u2013 to the beat of the slow march, after the tune [[Bonnie Charlie|\"Will ye no come back?\"]]. This custom (or something very like it) is also followed in Naval and Military colleges in many other countries, especially members and former members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Examples include the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], the [[Royal Military College (Malaysia)]], the [[National Defence Academy (India)]],<ref>[http://nda.nic.in National Defence Academy] Retrieved 8 February 2012.</ref> the [[Indian Military Academy]], the [[Officers Training Academy]] (India), the [[Pakistan Military Academy]], [[Bangladesh Military Academy]] and at the equivalent colleges in Singapore, Burma and Nigeria.\n*The song is very widely used by the international [[Scouting|Scout Movement]], where it is a popular closing song for jamborees and other occasions.<ref name=\"Honeck\"/><ref name=\"Brocklehurst\"/><ref name=\"Bracken\"/>\n\n====In non-English-speaking countries====\n\"Auld Lang Syne\" has been translated into many languages, and the song is widely sung all over the world. The song's pentatonic scale matches scales used in Korea, Japan, India, China and other East Asian countries, which has facilitated its \"nationalisation\" in the East. The following particular examples mostly detail things that are special or unusual about the use of the song in a particular country.\n*In Denmark, the song was translated in 1927 by the famous Danish poet [[Jeppe Aakj\u00e6r]]. Much like [[Robert Burns]]' use of dialect, Aakj\u00e6r translated the song into {{lang|da|Sallingbom\u00e5l}}, a form of the [[Jutlandic dialect]] often hard for other Danes to understand. The song \"{{lang|da|Skuld gammel venskab rejn forgo}}\" is an integral part of the Danish [[H\u00f8jskole]] tradition, and often associated with more rural areas and old traditions. Also, the former Danish rock group [[Gasolin]] modernised the melody in 1974 with their pop ballad \"Stakkels Jim\" (\"Poor Jim\").\n*In the Netherlands, the melody is best known as the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch football]] song \"{{lang|nl|[[Wij houden van Oranje]]}}\" (\"We Love Orange\"), performed by [[Andr\u00e9 Hazes]]. The melody is also used for a traditional song sung by members of the student association RKSV Albertus Magnus, located in [[Groningen]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n*In [[West Bengal]] and Bangladesh, the melody was the direct inspiration for the popular [[Bengali language|Bengali]] folk song  \"Purano shei diner kotha\" (\"Memories of the Good Old Days\"), composed by Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/bengali-traditional-folk-music-mw0000047187 |title = Bengali Traditional Folk Music \u2013 Various Artists \u2013 Songs, Reviews, Credits \u2013 AllMusic }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://musicjagat.com/category/bengali-mp3-songs/bengali-folk-songs |title = Bengali Folk Songs |access-date = 4 April 2015 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150325032009/http://musicjagat.com/category/bengali-mp3-songs/bengali-folk-songs |archive-date = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> and forms one of the more recognisable tunes in ''[[Rabindra Sangeet]]'' (\"Rabindra's Songs\"), a body of work of 2,230 songs and lyrical poems that form the backbone of Bengali music.\n*In Thailand, the song \"Samakkhi Chumnum\" (\"{{lang|th|\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e04\u0e04\u0e35\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21\u0e19\u0e38\u0e21}}\", 'Together in Unity'), which is set to the familiar melody, and used in similar contexts to other countries. The Thai lyrics are however unrelated to Burns' original words, but are a patriotic song about the King and national unity, so that many Thais are not aware of the song's \"Western\" origin.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first = Paul T. |editor1-last = Kennedy |editor2-first = Catherine J. |editor2-last = Danks |title = Globalization and National Identities: Crisis or Opportunity? |location =  |publisher = Springer |year = 2001 |isbn = 9780333985458 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vi6BDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA109 |page = 109 |via = Google Books }}</ref>\n*In Japan, although the original song is not unknown, people usually associate the melody with \"[[Hotaru no Hikari]]\", which also sets completely unconnected lyrics to the familiar tune. \"Hotaru no Hikari\" is played at many school graduation ceremonies, and at the end of the popular New Year's Eve show ''NHK [[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]''. It is played as background music in various establishments such as bars, restaurants, or [[department stores in Japan]] to let the customers know that the establishment is closing soon.\n*In South Korea, the song is known as \"Jakbyeol\" (\uc791\ubcc4, Farewell) or (less commonly) as \"Seokbyeol-ui Jeong\" (\uc11d\ubcc4\uc758 \uc815, The Feeling of Farewell). From 1919 to 1945 it served as the national anthem of the Korean exile government and from 1945 to 1948, it was the melody of South Korea's national anthem. The lyrics used then were the same as the current [[Aegukga|South Korean national anthem]].\n*Before 1972, it was the tune for the [[Gaumii salaam]] [[anthem]] of the Maldives (with the current words).\n\n===Use in films===\nThe strong and obvious associations of the song and its melody have made it a common staple for film soundtracks from the very early days of \"talking\" pictures to the present\u2014a large number of films and television series' episodes having used it for background, generally but by no means exclusively to evoke the New Year.\n\n==Notable performances==\n===Live and broadcast===\n*1939: [[Guy Lombardo]] and His Royal Canadians performed it on New Year's Eve for decades until his death in 1977. Several sources credit Lombardo with \"popularising\" the use of the song, at least in the United States.

The contention that Burns borrowed the melody from Shield is for various reasons highly unlikely, although they may very well both have taken it from a common source, possibly a [[strathspey (dance)|strathspey]] called \"The Miller's Wedding\" or \"The Miller's Daughter\".<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.themorgan.org/collection/Auld-Lang-Syne/4 |title = A Caledonian country dance |publisher =[[Morgan Library & Museum]]|date =  |access-date = 19 May 2019 }}</ref> The problem is that tunes based on the same set of dance steps necessarily have a similar rhythm, and even a superficial resemblance in melodic shape may cause a very strong apparent similarity in the tune as a whole. For instance, Burns' poem \"[[Comin' Thro' the Rye]]\" is sung to a tune that might also be based on the \"Miller's Wedding\". The origin of the tune of \"[[God Save the Queen]]\" presents a very similar problem and for just the same reason, as it is also based on a dance measure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scholes|first=Percy A.|authorlink=Percy Scholes|title=[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]|edition=Tenth|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= }}</ref> (See [[William Shield#The \"Auld Lang Syne\" controversy|the note in the William Shield article]] on this subject.)\n\n[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] wrote an arrangement of Auld Lang Syne ([[WoO]] 156/11) in the original brisk strathspey rhythm, published as part of his ''12 Scottish Folksongs'' (1814).\n\nIn 1855, different words were written for the Auld Lang Syne tune by Albert Laighton and titled, \"Song of the Old Folks\".

The song's pentatonic scale matches scales used in Korea, Japan, India, China and other East Asian countries, which has facilitated its \"nationalisation\" in the East. The following particular examples mostly detail things that are special or unusual about the use of the song in a particular country.\n*In Denmark, the song was translated in 1927 by the famous Danish poet [[Jeppe Aakj\u00e6r]]. Much like [[Robert Burns]]' use of dialect, Aakj\u00e6r translated the song into {{lang|da|Sallingbom\u00e5l}}, a form of the [[Jutlandic dialect]] often hard for other Danes to understand. The song \"{{lang|da|Skuld gammel venskab rejn forgo}}\" is an integral part of the Danish [[H\u00f8jskole]] tradition, and often associated with more rural areas and old traditions. Also, the former Danish rock group [[Gasolin]] modernised the melody in 1974 with their pop ballad \"Stakkels Jim\" (\"Poor Jim\").\n*In the Netherlands, the melody is best known as the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch football]] song \"{{lang|nl|[[Wij houden van Oranje]]}}\" (\"We Love Orange\"), performed by [[Andr\u00e9 Hazes]]. The melody is also used for a traditional song sung by members of the student association RKSV Albertus Magnus, located in [[Groningen]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n*In [[West Bengal]] and Bangladesh, the melody was the direct inspiration for the popular [[Bengali language|Bengali]] folk song  \"Purano shei diner kotha\" (\"Memories of the Good Old Days\"), composed by Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/bengali-traditional-folk-music-mw0000047187 |title = Bengali Traditional Folk Music \u2013 Various Artists \u2013 Songs, Reviews, Credits \u2013 AllMusic }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://musicjagat.com/category/bengali-mp3-songs/bengali-folk-songs |title = Bengali Folk Songs |access-date = 4 April 2015 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150325032009/http://musicjagat.com/category/bengali-mp3-songs/bengali-folk-songs |archive-date = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> and forms one of the more recognisable tunes in ''[[Rabindra Sangeet]]'' (\"Rabindra's Songs\"), a body of work of 2,230 songs and lyrical poems that form the backbone of Bengali music.\n*In Thailand, the song \"Samakkhi Chumnum\" (\"{{lang|th|\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e04\u0e04\u0e35\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21\u0e19\u0e38\u0e21}}\", 'Together in Unity'), which is set to the familiar melody, and used in similar contexts to other countries.

It is played as background music in various establishments such as bars, restaurants, or [[department stores in Japan]] to let the customers know that the establishment is closing soon.\n*In South Korea, the song is known as \"Jakbyeol\" (\uc791\ubcc4, Farewell) or (less commonly) as \"Seokbyeol-ui Jeong\" (\uc11d\ubcc4\uc758 \uc815, The Feeling of Farewell). From 1919 to 1945 it served as the national anthem of the Korean exile government and from 1945 to 1948, it was the melody of South Korea's national anthem. The lyrics used then were the same as the current [[Aegukga|South Korean national anthem]].\n*Before 1972, it was the tune for the [[Gaumii salaam]] [[anthem]] of the Maldives (with the current words).\n\n===Use in films===\nThe strong and obvious associations of the song and its melody have made it a common staple for film soundtracks from the very early days of \"talking\" pictures to the present\u2014a large number of films and television series' episodes having used it for background, generally but by no means exclusively to evoke the New Year.\n\n==Notable performances==\n===Live and broadcast===\n*1939: [[Guy Lombardo]] and His Royal Canadians performed it on New Year's Eve for decades until his death in 1977.

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles that carried the tag 'The Wednesday Play' (or 'The Wednesday Play presenting') on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats where the initial broadcast was not branded 'The Wednesday Play', but the repeat was. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n!

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles that carried the tag 'The Wednesday Play' (or 'The Wednesday Play presenting') on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats where the initial broadcast was not branded 'The Wednesday Play', but the repeat was.

The legal status of the Catholic Church and its property was recognised by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantine the Great]], and it became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] by the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380 by Emperor [[Theodosius I]].\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476, the temporal [[Legal history of the Catholic Church|legal jurisdisction]] of the [[papal primacy]] was further recognised as promulgated in [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Canon law]]. The Holy See was granted territory in Duchy of Rome by the [[Donation of Sutri]] in 728 of [[List of kings of the Lombards|King]] [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] of the [[Lombards]], and [[sovereignty]] by the [[Donation of Pepin]] in 756 by [[List of Frankish kings|King]] [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] of the [[Franks]].\n\nThe [[Papal States]] thus held extensive territory and armed forces in 756\u20131870. [[Pope Leo III]] [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] [[Charlemagne]] as Roman Emperor by ''[[translatio imperii]]'' in 800. The pope's [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] peaked around the time of the [[papal coronation]]s of the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 858, and the ''[[Dictatus papae]]'' in 1075, which conversely also described [[Papal deposing power]]. Several modern states still trace their own sovereignty to recognition in medieval papal bulls.\n\nThe sovereignty of the Holy See was retained despite multiple [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sacks of Rome]] during the Early Middle Ages. Yet, relations with the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the Holy Roman Empire were at times strained, reaching from the ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'' and ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'' regarding the \"[[Patrimony of Saint Peter]]\" in the 10th century, to the [[Investiture Controversy]] in 1076\u20131122, and settled again by the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The exiled [[Avignon Papacy]] during 1309\u20131376 also put a strain on the Papacy, which however finally returned to Rome. [[Pope Innocent X]] was critical of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 as it weakened the authority of the Holy See throughout much of [[Europe]]. Following the French Revolution, the Papal States were briefly occupied as the \"[[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]\" from 1798 to 1799 as a [[sister republic]] of the [[First French Empire]] under [[Napoleon and the Catholic Church|Napoleon]], before their territory was reestablished.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Holy See was represented in and identified as a \"permanent subject of general customary international law vis-\u00e0-vis all states\" in the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u20131815).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open-diplomacy.eu/blog/moral-diplomacy-of-the-holy-see-multi-level-diplomacy-of-a-tr | title='Moral Diplomacy' of the Holy See: Multi-Level Diplomacy of a Transnational Actor}}</ref> The Papal States were recognised under the rule of the Papacy and largely restored to their former extent. Despite the [[Capture of Rome]] in 1870 by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Roman Question]] during the [[Vatican during the Savoyard era (1870\u20131929)|Savoyard era]] (which made the pope a \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\" from 1870 to 1929), its international legal subject was \"constituted by the ongoing reciprocity of diplomatic relationships\" that not only were maintained but multiplied.\n\nThe [[Lateran Treaty]] on 11 February 1929 between the Holy See and Italy recognised Vatican City as an independent [[city-state]], along with extraterritorial [[Properties of the Holy See|properties]] around the region.

The legal status of the Catholic Church and its property was recognised by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantine the Great]], and it became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] by the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380 by Emperor [[Theodosius I]].\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476, the temporal [[Legal history of the Catholic Church|legal jurisdisction]] of the [[papal primacy]] was further recognised as promulgated in [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Canon law]]. The Holy See was granted territory in Duchy of Rome by the [[Donation of Sutri]] in 728 of [[List of kings of the Lombards|King]] [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] of the [[Lombards]], and [[sovereignty]] by the [[Donation of Pepin]] in 756 by [[List of Frankish kings|King]] [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] of the [[Franks]].\n\nThe [[Papal States]] thus held extensive territory and armed forces in 756\u20131870. [[Pope Leo III]] [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] [[Charlemagne]] as Roman Emperor by ''[[translatio imperii]]'' in 800. The pope's [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] peaked around the time of the [[papal coronation]]s of the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 858, and the ''[[Dictatus papae]]'' in 1075, which conversely also described [[Papal deposing power]]. Several modern states still trace their own sovereignty to recognition in medieval papal bulls.\n\nThe sovereignty of the Holy See was retained despite multiple [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sacks of Rome]] during the Early Middle Ages. Yet, relations with the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the Holy Roman Empire were at times strained, reaching from the ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'' and ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'' regarding the \"[[Patrimony of Saint Peter]]\" in the 10th century, to the [[Investiture Controversy]] in 1076\u20131122, and settled again by the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The exiled [[Avignon Papacy]] during 1309\u20131376 also put a strain on the Papacy, which however finally returned to Rome. [[Pope Innocent X]] was critical of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 as it weakened the authority of the Holy See throughout much of [[Europe]]. Following the French Revolution, the Papal States were briefly occupied as the \"[[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]\" from 1798 to 1799 as a [[sister republic]] of the [[First French Empire]] under [[Napoleon and the Catholic Church|Napoleon]], before their territory was reestablished.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Holy See was represented in and identified as a \"permanent subject of general customary international law vis-\u00e0-vis all states\" in the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u20131815).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open-diplomacy.eu/blog/moral-diplomacy-of-the-holy-see-multi-level-diplomacy-of-a-tr | title='Moral Diplomacy' of the Holy See: Multi-Level Diplomacy of a Transnational Actor}}</ref> The Papal States were recognised under the rule of the Papacy and largely restored to their former extent. Despite the [[Capture of Rome]] in 1870 by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Roman Question]] during the [[Vatican during the Savoyard era (1870\u20131929)|Savoyard era]] (which made the pope a \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\" from 1870 to 1929), its international legal subject was \"constituted by the ongoing reciprocity of diplomatic relationships\" that not only were maintained but multiplied.\n\nThe [[Lateran Treaty]] on 11 February 1929 between the Holy See and Italy recognised Vatican City as an independent [[city-state]], along with extraterritorial [[Properties of the Holy See|properties]] around the region. Since then, Vatican City is distinct from yet under \"full ownership, exclusive [[dominion]], and [[sovereignty|sovereign authority]] and [[jurisdiction]]\" of the Holy See ({{lang-la|Sancta Sedes}}).{{NoteTag|The Holy See is the central governing body of the Catholic Church and a sovereign entity recognized by international law, consisting of the pope and the [[Roman Curia]].
