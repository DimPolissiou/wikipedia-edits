After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

{"title_page": "English folk music", "text_new": "{{short description|Tradition-based music originating in England}}\n[[File:Pentangle in Amsterdam, 1969.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] performing in 1969]]\n{{Culture of England}}\n{{About-distinguish2|English folk music|[[English people{{!}}ethnic group from England]]}}\n\nThe '''folk music of England''' is a tradition-based music, which has been existed since the later [[medieval]] period. It is often contrasted with courtly, [[classical music|classical]] and later commercial music. Folk music has been preserved and transmitted orally, through print and later through recordings. The term is used to refer to English [[traditional music]] and music composed, or delivered, in a traditional style. English folk music has produced or contributed to several important musical genres, including [[sea shanties]], [[jigs]], [[hornpipe]]s and [[dance music]], such as that used for [[Morris dancing]]. It can be seen as having distinct regional and local variations in content and style, particularly in areas more removed from the cultural and political centres of the English state, as in [[Northumbria]], or the [[West Country]]. Cultural interchange and processes of migration mean that English folk music, although in many ways distinctive, has particularly interacted with the music of [[Music of Scotland|Scotland]]. It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and [[rock music]], influencing musical styles and producing [[Fusion (music)|musical fusions]], such as [[British folk rock]], [[folk punk]] and [[folk metal]]. There remains a flourishing [[sub-culture]] of English folk music, which continues to influence other genres and occasionally gains mainstream attention.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|right|Original score of ''Pastime with Good Company'' (c. 1513), held in the [[British Library]], [[London]].]]\n\nIn the strictest sense, English folk music has existed since the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] people in Britain after 400 CE. The [[Venerable Bede]]'s story of the cattleman and later ecclesiastical musician [[C\u00e6dmon]] indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'.<ref>R. I. Page, ''Life in Anglo-Saxon England'' (London: Batsford, 1970), pp. 159-60.</ref> Since this type of music was rarely notated, we have little knowledge of its form or content.<ref>C. Parrish, ''The Notation of Medieval Music'' (Maesteg: Pendragon Press, 1978).</ref> Some later tunes, like those used for [[Morris dance]], may have their origins in this period, but it is impossible to be certain of these relationships.<ref name=\"Forrest1999\">J. Forrest, ''The History of Morris Dancing, 1458\u20131750'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999), p. 48.</ref> We know from a reference in [[William Langland]]'s [[Piers Plowman]], that ballads about [[Robin Hood]] were being sung from at least by the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is [[Wynkyn de Worde]]'s collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\">B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 45-9.</ref>\n\n===16th century to the 18th century===\nWhile there was distinct court music, members of the social elite into the 16th century also seem to have enjoyed, and even to have contributed to the music of the people, as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] perhaps did with the tavern song \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\".<ref>D. Starkey, ''Henry VIII: A European Court in England'' (London: Collins & Brown in association with the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, 1991), p. 154.</ref> [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] argued that late medieval social elites had their own culture, but were culturally \u2018amphibious', able to participate in and affect popular traditions.<ref name=\"Burke1978\">[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], ''Popular Culture in Early Modern Europe'' (London: Billing, 1978), pp. 3, 17-19 and 28.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the changes in the wealth and culture of the upper social orders caused tastes in music to diverge.<ref name=\"Burke1978\"/><ref>D. C. Price, ''Patrons and Musicians of the English Renaissance'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), p. 5.</ref> There was an internationalisation of courtly music in terms of both instruments, such as the [[lute]], [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and early forms of the [[harpsichord]], and in form with the development of [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s, [[pavane]]s and [[galliard]]s.<ref>J. Wainwright, P. Holman, ''From Renaissance to Baroque: Change in Instruments and Instrumental Music in the Seventeenth Century'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2005).</ref> For other social orders, instruments like the pipe, [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]], [[bagpipe]], [[shawm]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], and [[crumhorn]] accompanied traditional music and community dance.<ref>M.

In the colonies, it mixed with styles of music brought by other immigrant groups to create a host of new genres. For instance, English ballads, combined with Irish, Scottish, and German musical traditions as well as the African banjo, became [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], which evolved, when combined with African-American blues, into [[rock and roll]].\n\n===Early 19th century===\nWith the [[Industrial Revolution]] the themes of the music of the labouring classes began to change from rural and agrarian life to include industrial [[work songs]].<ref name=\"Boyes1993\">G. Boyes, ''The Imagined Village: Culture, Ideology, and the English Folk Revival'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1993), p. 214.</ref> Awareness that older kinds of song were being abandoned prompted renewed interest in collecting folk songs during the 1830s and 1840s, including the work of [[William Sandys (antiquarian)|William Sandys]]' ''Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern'' (1833), William Chappell, ''A Collection of National English Airs'' (1838) and [[Robert Bell (writer)|Robert Bell]]'s ''Ancient Poems, Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of England'' (1846).<ref>W. B. Sandys, ''Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern'' (London, 1833); W. Chappell, ''A Collection of National English Airs'' (London, 1838) and R. Bell, ''Ancient Poems, Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of England'' (London, 1846).</ref>\n\nTechnological change made new instruments available and led to the development of silver and [[brass bands]], particularly in industrial centres in the north.<ref>D. Russell, ''Popular Music in England, 1840\u20131914: A Social History'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1987), pp. 160-90.</ref> The shift to urban centres also began to create new types of music, including from the 1850s the [[Music hall]], which developed from performances in ale houses into theatres and became the dominant locus of English popular music for over a century.<ref>D. Kift, ''The Victorian Music Hall: Culture, Class, and Conflict'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 17.</ref> This combined with increased literacy and print to allow the creation of new songs that initially built on, but began to differ from traditional music as composers like [[Lionel Monckton]] and [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] created music that reflected new social circumstances.<ref>W. Boosey, ''Fifty Years of Music'' (1931, Read Books, 2007), p. 161.</ref>\n\n===Folk revivals 1890\u20131969===\n{{Main|British folk revival}}\nFrom the late 19th century there were a series of movements that attempted to collect, record, preserve and later to perform, English folk music and dance. These are usually separated into two folk revivals.\n\nThe first, in the later 19th and early 20th centuries, involved figures including collectors [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] (1834\u20131924), [[Frank Kidson]] (1855\u20131926), [[Lucy Broadwood]] (1858\u20131939), and [[Anne Gilchrist (collector)|Anne Gilchrist]] (1863\u20131954), centred around the Folk Song Society, founded in 1911.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> [[Francis James Child]]'s (1825\u201396) eight-volume collection ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]'' (1882\u201392) became the most influential in defining the repertoire of subsequent performers, and [[Cecil Sharp]] (1859\u20131924), founder of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|English Folk Dance Society]], was probably the most important figure in understanding of the nature of folk song.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> The revival was part of a wider national movement in the period around the [[First World War]], and contributed to the creation of the [[English Pastoral School]] of classical music which incorporated traditional songs or motifs, as can be seen in the compositions of [[Percy Grainger]] (1882\u20131961), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (1872\u20131951), [[George Butterworth]] (1885\u20131916), [[Gustav Holst]] (1874\u20131934) and [[Frederick Delius]] (1862\u20131934).<ref name=\"Brocken2003\">M.

Derived from the French word 'chanter', meaning 'to sing', they may date from as early as the 15th century, but most recorded examples derive from the 19th century.<ref>R. A. Reuss and A. Green, ''Songs about Work: Essays in Occupational Culture'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1993), p. 335.</ref> Shanties were usually slow rhythmic songs designed to help with collective tasks on labour-intensive sailing and later steam ships. Many were [[call and response]] songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a lead line and the rest of the sailors giving a response together. They were derived from varied sources, including dances, folk songs, [[polka]]s, [[waltz]]es and even West African work-songs.<ref name=\"Hugill1980\">S. Hugill, ''Shanties from the Seven Seas: Shipboard Work-songs and Songs Used as Work-songs from the Great Days of Sail'' (Routledge, 1980). pp. 10-11 and 26.</ref> Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul shanties, for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; halyard shanties, for heavier work requiring more set-up time between pulls; and [[Capstan (nautical)|Capstan]] shanties, for long, repetitive tasks requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines.<ref name=\"Hugill1980\"/> Famous shanties include, the '[[Drunken Sailor]]' and '[[Blow the Man Down]]'. There was some interest in sea shanties in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger.<ref name=\"Bird1999\">J. Bird, ''Percy Grainger'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 125.</ref> In the second revival A. L.

Goodman and A. Tuck, eds, ''War and Border Societies in the Middle Ages'' (London: Routledge, 1992), pp. 6-7.</ref> The conflicts between England and Spain in the later 16th and early 17th centuries produced a number of ballads describing events, particularly naval conflicts like those of the [[Spanish Armada]].<ref name=\"SolaPinto1957\"/> The [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131653) produced a subgenre of \"[[Cavalier]] ballads\", including \"When the King Home in Peace Again\".<ref>C. Mackay, ed., ''The Cavalier Songs and Ballads of England, from 1642 to 1684'' (London: R.

E. Studwell, ''The National and Religious Song Reader: Patriotic, Traditional, and Sacred Songs from Around the World'' (Philadelphia, PA: Haworth Press, 1996), p. 55.</ref> Output became a flood during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1797\u20131815), seeing numerous patriotic war songs, like \u2018[[Heart of Oak]]\u2019 and the emergence of a stereotype of the English seaman as \u2018Jolly [[Jack Tar]]\u2019, who appeared in many ballads and on stage.<ref>J.

The two main types of work song in England are agricultural work songs, usually are [[rhythmic]] [[a cappella]] [[song]]s sung by people working on a physical and often repetitive task, like the 'Harvest song' common in south-west England.<ref>S. Baring-Gould, ''An Old English Home and Its Dependencies'' (1898, Read books, 2008), p. 205.</ref> The songs were probably intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings of boredom.<ref name=Peek2004>P. M. Peek and K. Yankah, ''African Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2004), p. 520.</ref> Rhythms of work songs can serve to synchronize physical movement in a group or gang. Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the 18th century, as workers took the music with which they were familiar, including [[ballads]] and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances.<ref name=Lloyd1967>A. L. Lloyd, ''Folk song in England'' (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1967), pp. 323-8.</ref> Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry.<ref>J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music, vol. 1: Media, Industry and Society'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003), p. 251.</ref> As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest [[protest songs]] and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile production]], mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries.<ref name=Lloyd1967/>\n\n==Regional traditions==\n\n===East Anglia===\n[[File:MollyDancers.jpg|thumb|right|Molly dancers at [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesea Straw Bear]] Festival]]\n\nLike many regions of England there are few distinctive local instruments and many songs were shared with the rest of Britain and with Ireland, although the distinct dialects of the regions sometimes lent them a particular stamp and, with one of the longest coastlines of any English region, songs about the sea were also particularly important. Along with the West Country, this was one of the regions that most firmly adopted reed instruments, producing many eminent practitioners of the melodeon from the mid-19th century. Also like the West Country it is one of the few regions where there is still an active tradition of [[step dancing]] and like the Midlands the tradition of [[Molly dance]] died out in the 1930s.<ref>'Step Dancing', ''East Anglian Traditional Music Trust'', http://www.eatmt.org.uk/stepdancing.htm, retrieved 16/02/09.</ref> The region was relatively neglected by folk song collectors of the first revival.

However, in more recent years a distinct cultural heritage has been recognised including unique folk traditions and songs, many associated with the regions industrial connections. It has also produced a number of important performers and some particular local instruments, such as the Lincolnshire [[bagpipes]], however the last player, John Hunsley, died in the 19th century and no actual examples of the pipes have survived.<ref>''The Pipers' Gathering'', http://www.pipersgathering.org/PB2004.shtml, retrieved 16/02/09.</ref> From the 19th century the instruments used appear to have been much like those in other regions, with fiddles, accordions and eventually silver and brass. Although, some traditions, like [[Molly dance]] died out in the 1930s, the Midlands retained strong traditions of both ceremonial and social dance, particularly in the south Midlands and [[Cotswolds]] and in the distinctive [[Border Morris]] from Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire.<ref name=\"Broughton1999\"/> The region also furnished some important material for folk songs, including a claim by Nottinghamshire for one of the most popular series of ballads, that of [[Robin Hood]], while local places appear in songs such as \u2018The Leicester Chambermaid\u2019 and \u2018Oxford\u2019 or \u2018Worcester City\u2019.<ref>R.

Northumbrian music is characterised by considerable influence from other regions, particularly southern [[Scotland]], other parts of the north of England and [[music of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref name=\"Broughton1999\"/> Local tunes were collected from the mid-18th century by figures including Henry Atkinson and William Vickers and in the first revival by John Bell, Bruce.

It had retained a strong tradition of wassailing, and seafaring songs were important in the coastal counties of Kent and Hampshire. Arguably the published collection of oral material was made in this area by John Broadwood, as ''Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex'' (1843).<ref>J. Broadwood, ''Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex, and Collected by One Who Has Learnt Them by Hearing Them Sung Every Christmas from Early Childhood, by the Country People, Who Go About to the Neighbouring Houses, Singing, or 'Wassailing' as It Is Called, at that Season.

The most significant British folk rock group from the region were the [[Oyster Band]], formed in Canterbury, while guitarist John Martyn came from Surrey and fiddle player Chris Leslie from Banbury in Oxfordshire. From the current crop of young folk musicians probably the most prominent are [[Spiers and Boden]] from Oxfordshire and [[Chris Wood (folk musician)|Chris Wood]], born in Kent.

It is often contrasted with courtly, [[classical music|classical]] and later commercial music. Folk music has been preserved and transmitted orally, through print and later through recordings. The term is used to refer to English [[traditional music]] and music composed, or delivered, in a traditional style. English folk music has produced or contributed to several important musical genres, including [[sea shanties]], [[jigs]], [[hornpipe]]s and [[dance music]], such as that used for [[Morris dancing]]. It can be seen as having distinct regional and local variations in content and style, particularly in areas more removed from the cultural and political centres of the English state, as in [[Northumbria]], or the [[West Country]]. Cultural interchange and processes of migration mean that English folk music, although in many ways distinctive, has particularly interacted with the music of [[Music of Scotland|Scotland]]. It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and [[rock music]], influencing musical styles and producing [[Fusion (music)|musical fusions]], such as [[British folk rock]], [[folk punk]] and [[folk metal]]. There remains a flourishing [[sub-culture]] of English folk music, which continues to influence other genres and occasionally gains mainstream attention.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|right|Original score of ''Pastime with Good Company'' (c. 1513), held in the [[British Library]], [[London]].]]\n\nIn the strictest sense, English folk music has existed since the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] people in Britain after 400 CE. The [[Venerable Bede]]'s story of the cattleman and later ecclesiastical musician [[C\u00e6dmon]] indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'.<ref>R.

In the colonies, it mixed with styles of music brought by other immigrant groups to create a host of new genres. For instance, English ballads, combined with Irish, Scottish, and German musical traditions as well as the African banjo, became [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], which evolved, when combined with African-American blues, into [[rock and roll]].\n\n===Early 19th century===\nWith the [[Industrial Revolution]] the themes of the music of the labouring classes began to change from rural and agrarian life to include industrial [[work songs]].<ref name=\"Boyes1993\">G.

These are usually separated into two folk revivals.\n\nThe first, in the later 19th and early 20th centuries, involved figures including collectors [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] (1834\u20131924), [[Frank Kidson]] (1855\u20131926), [[Lucy Broadwood]] (1858\u20131939), and [[Anne Gilchrist (collector)|Anne Gilchrist]] (1863\u20131954), centred around the Folk Song Society, founded in 1911.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> [[Francis James Child]]'s (1825\u201396) eight-volume collection ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]'' (1882\u201392) became the most influential in defining the repertoire of subsequent performers, and [[Cecil Sharp]] (1859\u20131924), founder of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|English Folk Dance Society]], was probably the most important figure in understanding of the nature of folk song.<ref name=\"Sweers2005pp45-9\"/> The revival was part of a wider national movement in the period around the [[First World War]], and contributed to the creation of the [[English Pastoral School]] of classical music which incorporated traditional songs or motifs, as can be seen in the compositions of [[Percy Grainger]] (1882\u20131961), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (1872\u20131951), [[George Butterworth]] (1885\u20131916), [[Gustav Holst]] (1874\u20131934) and [[Frederick Delius]] (1862\u20131934).<ref name=\"Brocken2003\">M.

Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 203.</ref> Many progressive folk performers continued to retain a traditional element in their music, including Jansch and Renbourn, who with [[Jacqui McShee]], [[Danny Thompson]], and [[Terry Cox]], formed [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Sweers2005p40\">B.

Some of this, particularly the Incredible String Band, has been seen as developing into the further subgenre of psych or [[psychedelic folk]] and had a considerable impact on [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref>J.

Housman, ''British Popular Ballads'' (London: Ayer, 1969), pp. 15 and 29.</ref> The traditional ballad has been seen as originating with the wandering [[minstrels]] of late medieval Europe.<ref name=\"Houseman1969\"/> There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are religious, supernatural, tragic, love, historic, legends and humour.<ref name=\"Houseman1969\"/> Many ballads were brought by English settlers to the [[New World]], thus forming the bedrock of American folk music.\n\n===Carols===\n{{Main|Carols}}\n\nA carol is a festive song. In modern times, carols are associated primarily with Christmas, but in reality there are carols celebrating all festivals and seasons of the year, and not necessarily Christian festivals. They were derived from a form of [[circle dance]] accompanied by singers, which was popular from the mid-12th century.<ref name=\"Walsh2001\">J. J. Walsh, ''Were They Wise Men Or Kings?: The Book of Christmas Questions'' (Westminster: John Knox Press, 2001), p. 60.</ref> From the 14th century they were used as processional songs, particularly at Advent, Easter and Christmas, and to accompany religious [[mystery plays]].<ref name=\"Phillips2008\">W. J. Phillips, ''Carols; Their Origin, Music, and Connection with Mystery-Plays'' (Routledge, 1921, Read Books, 2008), p. 24.</ref> They declined after the [[Protestant Reformation]] which banned many religious festivals, but some famous carols were written in this period, including '[[The Holly and the Ivy]]' and they were more strongly revived from the 19th century and began to be written and adapted by eminent composers.<ref>W.

Carpenter and M. Prichard, ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), pp. 363-4, 383.</ref> These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional [[riddles]], [[proverb]]s, [[ballads]], lines of [[Mummers]]' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals.<ref name=\"Carpenter1984\"/> Roughly half of the current body recognised 'traditional' English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century.<ref name=\"Opie1997\"/> From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes, like '[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]', which combined an 18th-century French tune with a poem by English writer [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]] and '[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]', written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830.<ref name=\"Carpenter1984\"/> The first, and possibly the most important collection to focus in this area was, [[James Orchard Halliwell]]'s, ''The Nursery Rhymes of England'' (1842) and ''Popular Rhymes and Tales'' in 1849.<ref>R. M. Dorson, ''The British Folklorists: a History'' (London, Taylor & Francis, 1999), p. 67.</ref> At the height of the revival [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] produced ''A Book of Nursery Songs'' (1895), and [[Andrew Lang]] produced ''The Nursery Rhyme Book'' in 1897.<ref name=\"Opie1997\"/> Children's songs, unlike folk songs, have remained part of a living and continuous tradition, for although added to from other sources and affected by written versions, most adults pass on songs they learned from oral sources as children.<ref name=\"Carpenter1984\"/>\n\n===Erotic folk songs===\nIt has been noted by most recent commentators on English folk song, that love, the erotic and even the pornographic, were major traditional themes and, if more than ballads are considered, may have been the largest groups of printed songs.<ref>J.

Lloyd was the key figure in introducing erotic songs to the canon, lecturing and publishing on the subject. He recorded ''The Foggy Dew and Other Traditional English Love Songs'' in 1959, and then ''The Bird in the Bush, Traditional Erotic Songs'' in 1966 with [[Frankie Armstrong]], and [[Anne Briggs]].<ref>B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 216.</ref> He drew a distinction between erotic songs, i.e. those that dealt with love and suggested sexuality through innuendo (like 'The Bonny Black Hare' and 'The Bird in the Bush'), and pornographic songs that were explicit and therefore unworthy of attention.<ref>R. Pegg, ''Folk'' (Wildwood House: London, 1976), p. 76.</ref> Some authors, however, find these distinctions more difficult to maintain. Although erotic songs became part of the standard fare in folk clubs and among folk rock musicians, relatively few of the more explicit songs have been placed on record.<ref>G.

The term jig was derived from the French 'giguer', meaning 'to jump'.<ref name=\"Ling1997\"/> It was known as a dance in the 16th century, often in 2/4 time and the term was used for a dancing entertainment in 16th century plays.<ref>C.

Raven, ed., ''One Thousand English Country Dance Tunes'' (Michael Raven, 1999), p. 106.</ref> In some, usually more northern, parts of England, these dances would be referred to as a \"Gallop\" - such as the Winster Gallop from Derbyshire (though this owes its origins to the Winster Morris).\n\n===Morris dance===\n{{Main|Morris dance}}\n[[File:Will Kemp Elizabethan Clown Jig.jpg|thumb|right|English Elizabethan clown Will Kempe dancing a jig from Norwich to London in 1600]]\n\nA morris dance is a type of English folk dance, usually accompanied by music, and based on rhythmic stepping and the execution of choreographed figures by a group of dancers, often using implements such as sticks, swords, and handkerchiefs. The name is thought to derive from the term 'moorish dance', for Spanish (Muslim) styles of dance and may derive from English court dances of the period.<ref>D.

Buckland, ''Dancing from Past to Present: Nation, Culture, Identities'' (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 199.</ref> Morris dance took something of a back seat to unaccompanied singing in the second revival, but received a further boost when it attracted the attention of British folk rock musicians like Ashley Hutchings, who produced several albums of dance music, including the influential ''[[Morris On]]'' series from 1972.<ref>B.

Green, ''Songs about Work: Essays in Occupational Culture'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1993), p. 335.</ref> Shanties were usually slow rhythmic songs designed to help with collective tasks on labour-intensive sailing and later steam ships. Many were [[call and response]] songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a lead line and the rest of the sailors giving a response together.

Goodman and A. Tuck, eds, ''War and Border Societies in the Middle Ages'' (London: Routledge, 1992), pp. 6-7.</ref> The conflicts between England and Spain in the later 16th and early 17th centuries produced a number of ballads describing events, particularly naval conflicts like those of the [[Spanish Armada]].<ref name=\"SolaPinto1957\"/> The [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131653) produced a subgenre of \"[[Cavalier]] ballads\", including \"When the King Home in Peace Again\".<ref>C.

The two main types of work song in England are agricultural work songs, usually are [[rhythmic]] [[a cappella]] [[song]]s sung by people working on a physical and often repetitive task, like the 'Harvest song' common in south-west England.<ref>S. Baring-Gould, ''An Old English Home and Its Dependencies'' (1898, Read books, 2008), p. 205.</ref> The songs were probably intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings of boredom.<ref name=Peek2004>P. M. Peek and K. Yankah, ''African Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2004), p. 520.</ref> Rhythms of work songs can serve to synchronize physical movement in a group or gang. Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the 18th century, as workers took the music with which they were familiar, including [[ballads]] and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances.<ref name=Lloyd1967>A. L. Lloyd, ''Folk song in England'' (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1967), pp. 323-8.</ref> Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry.<ref>J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music, vol. 1: Media, Industry and Society'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003), p. 251.</ref> As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest [[protest songs]] and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile production]], mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries.<ref name=Lloyd1967/>\n\n==Regional traditions==\n\n===East Anglia===\n[[File:MollyDancers.jpg|thumb|right|Molly dancers at [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesea Straw Bear]] Festival]]\n\nLike many regions of England there are few distinctive local instruments and many songs were shared with the rest of Britain and with Ireland, although the distinct dialects of the regions sometimes lent them a particular stamp and, with one of the longest coastlines of any English region, songs about the sea were also particularly important. Along with the West Country, this was one of the regions that most firmly adopted reed instruments, producing many eminent practitioners of the melodeon from the mid-19th century. Also like the West Country it is one of the few regions where there is still an active tradition of [[step dancing]] and like the Midlands the tradition of [[Molly dance]] died out in the 1930s.<ref>'Step Dancing', ''East Anglian Traditional Music Trust'', http://www.eatmt.org.uk/stepdancing.htm, retrieved 16/02/09.</ref> The region was relatively neglected by folk song collectors of the first revival.

He later collaborated with Cecil Sharp who, with Charles Marson, produced a three volume ''Folk-Songs from Somerset'' (1904\u201309).<ref>J.

Kellett, ''On Ilkla Mooar baht 'at: the Story of the Song''(Smith Settle, 1988).</ref> Most Yorkshire folk songs were not unique and tended to be adapted to fit local geography and dialect, as was the case with probably the most commercially successful Yorkshire song, \u2018[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]\u2019, recorded by [[Simon & Garfunkel]], which was a version of the Scottish ballad \u2018[[The Elfin Knight]]\u2019.<ref>F.

Originally from an alternate reality where Japan was divided into three regions by the actions of an alien being known as [[List of Kamen Rider Build characters#Evolto|Evolto]], Sento caused his reality to be absorbed into the \"prime\" Kamen Rider universe after using the Pandora Box to erase Evolto's existence from Earth's history.\n\nDue to Another Build's creation, Sento lost his memories as Build before Sougo arrived to Nascita to seek his help.

However, once he regained his memories and learned of Mirror Shinji's involvement, he was able to warn the real Shinji before he's killed by Shibaura.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Hassei Takano]]|\u9ad8\u91ce \u516b\u8aa0|Takano Hassei}} reprises his role as Miyuki Tezuka.\n\n===Jun Shibaura===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Ryuki'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters#Gai: Jun Shibaura|Jun Shibaura]]|\u829d\u6d66 \u6df3|Shibaura Jun}} is an arrogant, manipulative, well-versed computer programmer who fights in the Rider War as {{nihongo4|Kamen Rider Gai|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30ac\u30a4|Kamen Raid\u0101 Gai}} with his Contract Mirror Monster Metalgelas before he was betrayed and killed by Ouja. When the Rider War's events were averted, Shibaura is revived off-screen.\n\nDuring the events of ''Rider-Time: Ryuki'', Shibaura becomes the leader of his own group consisting of Ishibashi, Totsuka, and Tezuka. Despite not having his memories of the original Rider War, Shibaura's manipulative nature is still present as he convinces the latter that they're lovers and to betray Shinji's team before Tezuka's original memories returned. After Gai uses his Final Vent to kill Tezuka, Ryuga possessing Shinji's body kills him with his Final Vent. Out of all of the original Rider War participants who were drafted into the second one, Shibaura was the only one who didn't regain his original memories.\n\n{{nihongo4|Satoshi Ichijo|\u4e00\u689d \u4fca|Ichij\u014d Satoshi}} reprises his role as Jun Shibaura.\n\n===Takeshi Asakura===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Ryuki'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters#Ouja: Takeshi Asakura|Takeshi Asakura]]|\u6d45\u5009 \u5a01|Asakura Takeshi}} is a bad-tempered and sadistic criminal who fought in the Rider War as {{nihongo4|Kamen Rider Ouja|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u738b\u86c7|Kamen Raid\u0101 \u014cja}} with his Contract Mirror Monster Venosnaker. Unlike many of the other Riders who died as a result of the Rider War, Asakura met his end after he was cornered by the police forces and gunned down. When the Rider War's events were averted, Asakura is revived, but his sadism was still present.\n\nDuring the events of ''Rider Time: Ryuki'', Asakura was inducted into a new Rider War. Unlike the original participants, he retained his memories and shows more contempt in fighting against his old foes. Having killed the new user of Kamen Rider Tiger, Asakura finds company in the amnesiac Goro and tries to hunt both Shinji and Ren. After killing Goro, Asakura made his last attempt to kill Ren in the middle of his fight with possessed Shinji before losing his life.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Takashi Hagino]]|\u8429\u91ce \u5d07|Hagino Takashi}} reprises his role as Takeshi Asakura.\n\n===Kamen Rider Odin===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Ryuki'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters#Odin|Kamen Rider Odin]]|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|Kamen Raid\u0101 \u014cdin}} is a mysterious golden entity who fights with his Contract Mirror Monster Goldphoenix; possessing humans lured by Shiro in order to act on his behalf. As such, he couldn't be killed, as he can possess another human. After Odin and Ren became the last two standing and engaged each other in a climactic battle, the former vanished after Yui died; rendering the Rider War null and void, and making Ren the winner by default.\n\nDuring the events of ''Rider Time: Kamen Rider Ryuki'', Odin returned and possessed an unknown white hooded man to restart the Rider War after convincing Tatsuya he could save his dying girlfriend, Sara; turning him into the Another Rider, Another Ryuki in order to carry out Shiro's original command to revive Yui. To further his plot, he also gave Tatsuya a soul gem so he can collect the souls of his defeated opponents and use them to ostensibly revive Sara. Once his pawn realized he was hurting Sara more than he was helping her, Odin brainwashes him and sends him into a berserker state. However, Zi-O Decade Armor Ryuki Form defeated and rescued Tatsuya. In the real world, Odin made himself known by using all three Survive cards in his Ride Visor, granting himself immortality until Zi-O and Geiz used the Ryuki and Knight Ridewatches to cancel this ability. With one Survive card left, Odin was defeated once and for all; whispering Yui's name with his dying breath.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Tsuyoshi Koyama]]|\u5c0f\u5c71 \u525b\u5fd7|Koyama Tsuyoshi}} reprises his voice role as Kamen Rider Odin.\n\n===Mirror Shinji===\nOriginally hailing from an alternate continuity depicted in ''[[Kamen Rider Ryuki: Episode Final]]'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters#Ryuga: Mirror Shinji|Kamen Rider Ryuga]]|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30ac|Kamen Raid\u0101 Ry\u016bga}} is an evil Mirror counterpart of Shinji Kido that was created by a lonely Yui Kanzaki in the image of Shinji, whom she met as a child and was seemingly abandoned by him. As a being from the Mirror World, possessing all the abilities of Kamen Rider Ryuki, Mirror Shinji participated in the Rider War to survive in the real world indefinitely by taking Shinji's body as his own. But Yui's act of allowing herself to succumb to her illness causes Shinji to purge his doppelganger and destroy him in a clash between their Final Vents.\n\nIn the original reality, Mirror Shinji is Kido's literal reflection who represents the darker aspects of his personality, such as constantly blaming readers of the ORE Journal for their part in his workplace's disbandment. Taking Tsukasa's alternate dimension theory to heart, Heure manages to summon Ryuga by shattering a mirror a thousand times and transforms him into an Another Rider version of his old Rider form, {{nihongo4|Another Ryuga|\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30ac|Anaz\u0101 Ry\u016bga}}. With his newfound power, Ryuga proceeds to hunt down ORE Journal readers and accidentally bring Sougo into an encounter with his own mirror twin. After his defeat by Zi-O II, Sougo told Ryuga that Shinji had accepted him as a part of himself, thus allowing Shinji to regain his reflection.\n\nDuring the events of ''Rider Time: Ryuki'' however, the mirror twin refused to accept this and participated in the second Rider War. His manipulation on Tezuka into betraying Jun Shibaura becomes an orchestral for Tezuka, Ren and Shinji progressively remembers their original Rider War memories, and possessed Shinji to fight against Shinji's own allies, while also manage to kill Gai. Despite his best efforts, the real Shinji emerged victorious as the mirror twin was suppressed and all both opposing and allied Riders were killed; allowing the former to return to the real world.\n\nAn alternate reality version of his Contract Mirror Monster, Dragblacker, was brought to Sougo's world from Ryuki Ridewatch's destruction. It assisted the Raydragoons in destroying the world until it was killed by Ohma Zi-O.\n\nAs Another Ryuga, \"Shinji\" gains the ability to enter and survive in the human world with no time limit, unlike his old Kamen Rider form, and is armed with twisted versions of his original Kamen Rider weapons. He can also repel incoming attacks back to their opponents with two times the power. As a result of being unique as he's both the original version of his Another Rider form and a Mirror World inhabitant, it would be nearly impossible to acquire his corresponding Ridewatch. Despite that, Sougo was able to defeat him as Kamen Rider Zi-O II. As he hailed from the Mirror World, Ryuga's Another Rider form is reversed compared to the other Another Riders; which is denoted by his Another Rider name and the year of his creation being mirrored.\n\nAs with the real Shinji Kido, the Mirror Shinji is also reprised by Takamasa Suga.\n\n===Daisuke Okubo===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Ryuki'', {{nihongo4|Daisuke Okubo|\u5927\u4e45\u4fdd \u5927\u4ecb|\u014ckubo Daisuke}} is the chief editor and one of Shinji's seniors at ORE Journal until its shutdown due to the rise of social media. Sougo encountered Okubo at a fishing pond, who told him about Shinji while the former was investigating the mysterious deaths of ORE Journal readers.

Due to his boss being diagnosed with cancer and his dwindling time, Goro took his place as the second Zolda and ended up killed by Kitaoka's rival, Takeshi Asakura/Kamen Rider Ouja. When the Rider War's events were averted, Goro and Kitaoka are revived.\n\nDuring the events of ''Rider Time: Ryuki'', Goro was inducted into the new Mirror Rider War as Kamen Rider Zolda since Kitaoka had died by this time. Per his late boss' final wish, Goro at first feigned loyalty to Asakura before eventually striking back at him when the time was right.

Revealed to be one of many humans who possessed an Agito's Seed, he learns that they're all being targeted by the monstrous Lords, who consider themselves humanity's protectors from both external and internal threats. Shouichi is adopted by the Misugi family as he begins to piece his missing memories together before opening a restaurant named after the fallen Agito's Seeds victims once the Lords have been defeated.\n\nIn 2019, Shouichi was in the middle of cooking practice in France. By the time he heard the news of an Another Agito army attacking Tokyo, he returned to Japan to aid SAUL, the G3 army, and the Time Riders in turning the civilians who were transformed into the Another Agito army by the Time Jackers back to normal. His return to Japan was actually part of the Time Jackers' plan to steal his powers and empower their lead Another Agito, leaving Shouichi powerless and forced to don one of the mass-produced G3 suits to aid the Time Riders. Though Shouichi regains his powers due to Tsukuyomi reawakening her Time Jacker powers, helping Zi-O Trinity defeat the lead Another Agito as Agito Trinity, he decides to live a normal life and entrusts his sealed Ridewatch power to the Time Riders.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Toshiki Kashu]]|\u8cc0\u96c6 \u5229\u6a39|Kash\u016b Toshiki}} reprises his role as Shouichi Tsugami.

Upon becoming the first Another Rider, he became power drunk and started to eliminate those who inherited the Agito's Seeds, including Shouichi, until Kino learned the error of his ways and became a better man for it. He later sacrificed his life to give Agito and Gills time to destroy the Lord, Ericius Liquor.\n\nIn 2019, the Time Jackers created a new Another Agito to infect civilians and convert them into his zombie-like army to lure out the real Agito, the Time Riders, SAUL, and the G3 army while causing widespread infection across the globe, starting with Japan. Although all of the Time Jackers' Another Agitos have a different head crest and more prominent mouth, the leader's appearance remained mostly the same as the original Another Agito; though he has Agito's name and the year date of his creation on his chest to match the other Another Riders, and a recolored belt. As for the infected army, they retain their civilian outfits.\n\nAfter luring the real Agito back to Japan, the Time Jackers steal his powers and use them to empower the Another Agito leader, until Tsukuyomi awakened a power similar to the Time Jackers and helps the real Agito regain his powers temporarily. Once the Another Agito leader is defeated by Double Trinity Rider Kicks from Zi-O and Agito's Trinity Forms, all of the Another Agito victims are cured.\n\nThe primary Another Agito can bite his victims to give himself a numbers advantage, implanting corrupted Agito's Seeds into their bodies, and is armed with a twisted version of the Shining Calibur. While infused with the real Agito's powers via the corresponding Ridewatch, the lead Another Agito gains the ability to create more Another Agitos at a time by firing a purple beam from his chest instead of using his bite and gains twisted versions of the Flame Saber and the Storm Halberd. Though individual Another Agitos can be changed back, the only way to turn all of the zombified civilians back to normal at the same time is to destroy the leader.\n\n===Kamen Rider G3===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Agito'', {{nihongo4|Kamen Rider G3|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fcG3|Kamen Raid\u0101 J\u012b Sur\u012b}} is a series of powered suits developed by a special branch of Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department, the Squad of Anti-Unidentified Lifeforms, following the MPD's battle against the Gurongi Tribe in ''Kamen Rider Kuuga''. The system of the G3 suits' development uses the first Heisei Kamen Rider, Kuuga as the basis, with the most well-known first compatible user being the Akatsuki incident hero, {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Makoto Hikawa|Makoto Hikawa]]|\u6c37\u5ddd \u8aa0|Hikawa Makoto}}. When the Lords (known as \"Unknown\" by the MPD) begin to attack the bearers of Agito's Seeds since that incident, G3 is deployed to stop them. After a series of tests while combating the Lords alongside Agito, Gills, and the original Another Agito, the G3 suits underwent significant upgrades in order to match them; such as G3-Mild, a planned mass-produced version of the G3 suit (which was eventually made defunct), then finally its final upgrade, G3-X. During the final battle against the last El Lords, Hikawa dons the G3-X suit one more time before going back to his normal police life.\n\nIn 2019, it is the original G3 suit that has become mass-produced instead of their Mild counterpart. The G3 Army aids both Agito and the Time Riders in turning the people who were transformed into the Another Agito army by the Time Jackers back to normal. Due to Shouichi being lured into the Time Jackers' trap and having his powers stolen by them to empower their lead Another Agito, he's forced to wear the original G3 suit until he gets his powers back.\n\n===Takahiro Omuro===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Agito'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Takahiro Omuro|Takahiro Omuro]]|\u5c3e\u5ba4 \u9686\u5f18|Omuro Takahiro}} is the comic relief member of the SAUL branch of the MPD and the main driver for Kamen Rider G3's mobile command RV, G-Mobile.

After all of the Lords were defeated, Omuro went on to lead the G5 Unit squad.\n\nIn 2019, Takahiro and his new SAUL team began testing a mass-produced version of the original Kamen Rider G3 suit as part of a final test. However, the Time Jackers and their version of Another Agito attack SAUL to lure the real Agito back to Japan in order to steal his powers while causing a widespread infection by turning civilians into an Another Agito army.\n\n{{nihongo4|Akiyoshi Shibata|\u67f4\u7530 \u660e\u826f|Shibata Akiyoshi}} reprises his role as Takahiro Omuro.\n\n===Mana Kazaya===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Agito'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Mana Kazaya|Mana Kazaya]]|\u98a8\u8c37 \u771f\u9b5a|Kazaya Mana}} is the daughter of [[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Nobuyuki Kazaya|Nobuyuki Kazaya]] and niece of [[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Yoshihiko Misugi|Yoshihiko Misugi]] who happens to inherit an Agito's Seed like Shouichi, despite not being involved in the Akatsuki incident, and gains psychic powers.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Rina Akiyama]]|\u79cb\u5c71 \u8389\u5948|Akiyama Rina}} reprises her role as Mana Kazaya.\n\n===Kamen Rider G4===\nReturning from ''[[Kamen Rider Agito#Movies and specials|Kamen Rider Agito: Project G4]]'', {{nihongo4|Kamen Rider G4|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fcG4|Kamen Raid\u0101 J\u012b F\u014d}}, whose true identity is {{nihongo4|Shiro Mizuki|\u6c34\u57ce \u53f2\u6717|Mizuki Shir\u014d}}, was the second lieutenant of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's GA Division who used the G4 System battle suit (based on stolen plans for the G3 suit) before he was killed in battle and its A.I. nearly took on a life of its own before it was destroyed.\n\nIn an alternate reality, Mizuki succeeded in his goals (though it's unknown whether he survived the suit's side effects or if the A.I. had completely taken over), before he was summoned to Another World by Swartz to join his Dark Rider army and help him achieve his goals.

From Riku's remains, Tid created the Kuuga Anotherwatch; but unbeknownst to the Time Jacker, Geiz managed to absorb the hero's essence into the Kuuga Ridewatch before the tomb collapsed.

Despite this, Kyosuke took on Sougo's childhood friend, Tsutomu Tsuzumiya, as his disciple. After said disciple is turned into Another Hibiki by the Time Jackers however, he becomes conflicted over fighting his student on his own or with the Time Riders and Todoroki. Feeling responsible for never officially taking the title of Hibiki, which led him to separate from Tsutomu in the first place, Kyosuke finally accepts it.

With one Survive card left, Odin was defeated once and for all; whispering Yui's name with his dying breath.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Tsuyoshi Koyama]]|\u5c0f\u5c71 \u525b\u5fd7|Koyama Tsuyoshi}} reprises his voice role as Kamen Rider Odin.\n\n===Mirror Shinji===\nOriginally hailing from an alternate continuity depicted in ''[[Kamen Rider Ryuki: Episode Final]]'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters#Ryuga: Mirror Shinji|Kamen Rider Ryuga]]|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30ac|Kamen Raid\u0101 Ry\u016bga}} is an evil Mirror counterpart of Shinji Kido that was created by a lonely Yui Kanzaki in the image of Shinji, whom she met as a child and was seemingly abandoned by him. As a being from the Mirror World, possessing all the abilities of Kamen Rider Ryuki, Mirror Shinji participated in the Rider War to survive in the real world indefinitely by taking Shinji's body as his own. But Yui's act of allowing herself to succumb to her illness causes Shinji to purge his doppelganger and destroy him in a clash between their Final Vents.\n\nIn the original reality, Mirror Shinji is Kido's literal reflection who represents the darker aspects of his personality, such as constantly blaming readers of the ORE Journal for their part in his workplace's disbandment. Taking Tsukasa's alternate dimension theory to heart, Heure manages to summon Ryuga by shattering a mirror a thousand times and transforms him into an Another Rider version of his old Rider form, {{nihongo4|Another Ryuga|\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30ac|Anaz\u0101 Ry\u016bga}}. With his newfound power, Ryuga proceeds to hunt down ORE Journal readers and accidentally bring Sougo into an encounter with his own mirror twin. After his defeat by Zi-O II, Sougo told Ryuga that Shinji had accepted him as a part of himself, thus allowing Shinji to regain his reflection.\n\nDuring the events of ''Rider Time: Ryuki'' however, the mirror twin refused to accept this and participated in the second Rider War. His manipulation on Tezuka into betraying Jun Shibaura becomes an orchestral for Tezuka, Ren and Shinji progressively remembers their original Rider War memories, and possessed Shinji to fight against Shinji's own allies, while also manage to kill Gai. Despite his best efforts, the real Shinji emerged victorious as the mirror twin was suppressed and all both opposing and allied Riders were killed; allowing the former to return to the real world.\n\nAn alternate reality version of his Contract Mirror Monster, Dragblacker, was brought to Sougo's world from Ryuki Ridewatch's destruction. It assisted the Raydragoons in destroying the world until it was killed by Ohma Zi-O.\n\nAs Another Ryuga, \"Shinji\" gains the ability to enter and survive in the human world with no time limit, unlike his old Kamen Rider form, and is armed with twisted versions of his original Kamen Rider weapons. He can also repel incoming attacks back to their opponents with two times the power. As a result of being unique as he's both the original version of his Another Rider form and a Mirror World inhabitant, it would be nearly impossible to acquire his corresponding Ridewatch. Despite that, Sougo was able to defeat him as Kamen Rider Zi-O II. As he hailed from the Mirror World, Ryuga's Another Rider form is reversed compared to the other Another Riders; which is denoted by his Another Rider name and the year of his creation being mirrored.\n\nAs with the real Shinji Kido, the Mirror Shinji is also reprised by Takamasa Suga.\n\n===Daisuke Okubo===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Ryuki'', {{nihongo4|Daisuke Okubo|\u5927\u4e45\u4fdd \u5927\u4ecb|\u014ckubo Daisuke}} is the chief editor and one of Shinji's seniors at ORE Journal until its shutdown due to the rise of social media. Sougo encountered Okubo at a fishing pond, who told him about Shinji while the former was investigating the mysterious deaths of ORE Journal readers. When Shinji finally accepted Ryuga as a part of himself, he reconciles with Okubo as they moved on from ORE Journal's disbandment.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Kanji Tsuda]]|\u6d25\u7530 \u5bdb\u6cbb|Tsuda Kanji}} reprises his role as Daisuke Okubo.\n\n===Goro Yura===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Ryuki'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters#Goro Yura|Goro Yura]]|\u7531\u826f \u543e\u90ce|Yura Gor\u014d}} is the loyal servant of the super-lawyer [[List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters#Shuichi Kitaoka|Shuichi Kitaoka]], {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Ryuki characters#Zolda|Kamen Rider Zolda]]|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30be\u30eb\u30c0|Kamen Raid\u0101 Zoruda}}, whom Goro repaid when he was the lawyer's client. Due to his boss being diagnosed with cancer and his dwindling time, Goro took his place as the second Zolda and ended up killed by Kitaoka's rival, Takeshi Asakura/Kamen Rider Ouja. When the Rider War's events were averted, Goro and Kitaoka are revived.\n\nDuring the events of ''Rider Time: Ryuki'', Goro was inducted into the new Mirror Rider War as Kamen Rider Zolda since Kitaoka had died by this time. Per his late boss' final wish, Goro at first feigned loyalty to Asakura before eventually striking back at him when the time was right. Goro died from his injuries first while Asakura went through the same after barely surviving his fight against Ren.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Tomohisa Yuge]]|\u5f13\u524a \u667a\u4e45|Yuge Tomohisa}} reprises his role as Goro Yura.\n\n==''Kamen Rider Agito''==\n===Shouichi Tsugami===\nThe titular Rider of {{nihongo4|''[[Kamen Rider Agito]]''|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30a2\u30ae\u30c8|Kamen Raid\u0101 Agito}}, born {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Shouichi Tsugami|Tetsuya Sawaki]]|\u6ca2\u6728 \u54f2\u4e5f|Sawaki Tetsuya}}, who suffered amnesia and assumed the name of the scientist he met, his would be brother in-law, {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Tetsuya Sawaki|Shouichi Tsugami]]|\u6d25\u4e0a \u7fd4\u4e00|Tsugami Sh\u014dichi}}. Revealed to be one of many humans who possessed an Agito's Seed, he learns that they're all being targeted by the monstrous Lords, who consider themselves humanity's protectors from both external and internal threats. Shouichi is adopted by the Misugi family as he begins to piece his missing memories together before opening a restaurant named after the fallen Agito's Seeds victims once the Lords have been defeated.\n\nIn 2019, Shouichi was in the middle of cooking practice in France. By the time he heard the news of an Another Agito army attacking Tokyo, he returned to Japan to aid SAUL, the G3 army, and the Time Riders in turning the civilians who were transformed into the Another Agito army by the Time Jackers back to normal. His return to Japan was actually part of the Time Jackers' plan to steal his powers and empower their lead Another Agito, leaving Shouichi powerless and forced to don one of the mass-produced G3 suits to aid the Time Riders. Though Shouichi regains his powers due to Tsukuyomi reawakening her Time Jacker powers, helping Zi-O Trinity defeat the lead Another Agito as Agito Trinity, he decides to live a normal life and entrusts his sealed Ridewatch power to the Time Riders.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Toshiki Kashu]]|\u8cc0\u96c6 \u5229\u6a39|Kash\u016b Toshiki}} reprises his role as Shouichi Tsugami.

Upon becoming the first Another Rider, he became power drunk and started to eliminate those who inherited the Agito's Seeds, including Shouichi, until Kino learned the error of his ways and became a better man for it. He later sacrificed his life to give Agito and Gills time to destroy the Lord, Ericius Liquor.\n\nIn 2019, the Time Jackers created a new Another Agito to infect civilians and convert them into his zombie-like army to lure out the real Agito, the Time Riders, SAUL, and the G3 army while causing widespread infection across the globe, starting with Japan. Although all of the Time Jackers' Another Agitos have a different head crest and more prominent mouth, the leader's appearance remained mostly the same as the original Another Agito; though he has Agito's name and the year date of his creation on his chest to match the other Another Riders, and a recolored belt. As for the infected army, they retain their civilian outfits.\n\nAfter luring the real Agito back to Japan, the Time Jackers steal his powers and use them to empower the Another Agito leader, until Tsukuyomi awakened a power similar to the Time Jackers and helps the real Agito regain his powers temporarily. Once the Another Agito leader is defeated by Double Trinity Rider Kicks from Zi-O and Agito's Trinity Forms, all of the Another Agito victims are cured.\n\nThe primary Another Agito can bite his victims to give himself a numbers advantage, implanting corrupted Agito's Seeds into their bodies, and is armed with a twisted version of the Shining Calibur. While infused with the real Agito's powers via the corresponding Ridewatch, the lead Another Agito gains the ability to create more Another Agitos at a time by firing a purple beam from his chest instead of using his bite and gains twisted versions of the Flame Saber and the Storm Halberd. Though individual Another Agitos can be changed back, the only way to turn all of the zombified civilians back to normal at the same time is to destroy the leader.\n\n===Kamen Rider G3===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Agito'', {{nihongo4|Kamen Rider G3|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fcG3|Kamen Raid\u0101 J\u012b Sur\u012b}} is a series of powered suits developed by a special branch of Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department, the Squad of Anti-Unidentified Lifeforms, following the MPD's battle against the Gurongi Tribe in ''Kamen Rider Kuuga''. The system of the G3 suits' development uses the first Heisei Kamen Rider, Kuuga as the basis, with the most well-known first compatible user being the Akatsuki incident hero, {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Makoto Hikawa|Makoto Hikawa]]|\u6c37\u5ddd \u8aa0|Hikawa Makoto}}. When the Lords (known as \"Unknown\" by the MPD) begin to attack the bearers of Agito's Seeds since that incident, G3 is deployed to stop them. After a series of tests while combating the Lords alongside Agito, Gills, and the original Another Agito, the G3 suits underwent significant upgrades in order to match them; such as G3-Mild, a planned mass-produced version of the G3 suit (which was eventually made defunct), then finally its final upgrade, G3-X. During the final battle against the last El Lords, Hikawa dons the G3-X suit one more time before going back to his normal police life.\n\nIn 2019, it is the original G3 suit that has become mass-produced instead of their Mild counterpart. The G3 Army aids both Agito and the Time Riders in turning the people who were transformed into the Another Agito army by the Time Jackers back to normal. Due to Shouichi being lured into the Time Jackers' trap and having his powers stolen by them to empower their lead Another Agito, he's forced to wear the original G3 suit until he gets his powers back.\n\n===Takahiro Omuro===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Agito'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Takahiro Omuro|Takahiro Omuro]]|\u5c3e\u5ba4 \u9686\u5f18|Omuro Takahiro}} is the comic relief member of the SAUL branch of the MPD and the main driver for Kamen Rider G3's mobile command RV, G-Mobile.

After all of the Lords were defeated, Omuro went on to lead the G5 Unit squad.\n\nIn 2019, Takahiro and his new SAUL team began testing a mass-produced version of the original Kamen Rider G3 suit as part of a final test. However, the Time Jackers and their version of Another Agito attack SAUL to lure the real Agito back to Japan in order to steal his powers while causing a widespread infection by turning civilians into an Another Agito army.\n\n{{nihongo4|Akiyoshi Shibata|\u67f4\u7530 \u660e\u826f|Shibata Akiyoshi}} reprises his role as Takahiro Omuro.\n\n===Mana Kazaya===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Agito'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Mana Kazaya|Mana Kazaya]]|\u98a8\u8c37 \u771f\u9b5a|Kazaya Mana}} is the daughter of [[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Nobuyuki Kazaya|Nobuyuki Kazaya]] and niece of [[List of Kamen Rider Agito characters#Yoshihiko Misugi|Yoshihiko Misugi]] who happens to inherit an Agito's Seed like Shouichi, despite not being involved in the Akatsuki incident, and gains psychic powers.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Rina Akiyama]]|\u79cb\u5c71 \u8389\u5948|Akiyama Rina}} reprises her role as Mana Kazaya.\n\n===Kamen Rider G4===\nReturning from ''[[Kamen Rider Agito#Movies and specials|Kamen Rider Agito: Project G4]]'', {{nihongo4|Kamen Rider G4|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fcG4|Kamen Raid\u0101 J\u012b F\u014d}}, whose true identity is {{nihongo4|Shiro Mizuki|\u6c34\u57ce \u53f2\u6717|Mizuki Shir\u014d}}, was the second lieutenant of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's GA Division who used the G4 System battle suit (based on stolen plans for the G3 suit) before he was killed in battle and its A.I. nearly took on a life of its own before it was destroyed.\n\nIn an alternate reality, Mizuki succeeded in his goals (though it's unknown whether he survived the suit's side effects or if the A.I. had completely taken over), before he was summoned to Another World by Swartz to join his Dark Rider army and help him achieve his goals.

Riku's belt ends up bonding to Yusuke Godai, who takes the warrior's place as Kuuga to stop the revived Gurongi from slaughtering humanity.\n\nDuring the events of ''Heisei Generations Forever'', Tid invaded the Kurougatake ruins on January 29, 2000, a day before Yusuke Godai became Kuuga. From Riku's remains, Tid created the Kuuga Anotherwatch; but unbeknownst to the Time Jacker, Geiz managed to absorb the hero's essence into the Kuuga Ridewatch before the tomb collapsed. As an army of past Riders came to the civilians' aid, another Kamen Rider Kuuga was seen delivering the final blow, which lead to Another Ultimate Kuuga's defeat.\n\n===Kamen Rider Kuuga (Manga)===\nInstead of the television character himself, the [[Kamen Rider Kuuga#Manga|2014 manga version]] of {{nihongo4|Yusuke Godai|\u4e94\u4ee3 \u96c4\u4ecb|Godai Y\u016bsuke}} is a youth who was chosen by the mummified remains of Riku to succeed the latter as Kuuga in the modern era after the Gurongi escaped.\n\nIn ''Kamen Rider Zi-O the Movie: Over Quartzer'', this particular Kuuga was summoned from a discarded manga as part of the reinforcements who stood against the Quartzers' Kasshine army.

After sealing the Caucasus Undead and achieving his King Form, it is later revealed that B.O.A.R.D. became corrupted by the CEO, Hiroshi Tennoji, and used said King Form to expose him to Undead cells. As Kazuma overuses the King Form (despite its side effect and Hajime's identity as the Black Joker Undead being exposed in front of him prior to achieving his ultimate form), he's forced to confront Hajime after he unwittingly brings destruction to all life on Earth as the winner of the new Battle Fight. In the end, Kazuma sacrificed his humanity and became another Joker Undead to ensure Hajime could coexist with humans and halt [[mass extinction]].\n\nEven in spite of Another Blade's creation, Kazuma retains his powers as Kamen Rider Blade due to his status as a Joker as he re-emerges after a long period of hiding. Kazuma is provoked into attacking Hajime upon learning he is using his powers after all the heavy sacrifices he made for him. When Amane was forcibly turned into Another Blade again by White Woz, she absorbed Kazuma and Hajime's Undead cells; giving the former his humanity back and making the latter completely human. After Zi-O Trinity defeats Another Blade and effectively prevents the mass destruction that was caused by her absorbed Joker cells, Kazuma and Hajime entrust their Ridewatches to the Time Riders.\n\n{{nihongo4|[[Takayuki Tsubaki]]|\u693f \u9686\u4e4b|Tsubaki Takayuki}} reprises his role as Kazuma Kenzaki.\n\n===Hajime Aikawa===\nAlso returning from ''Kamen Rider Blade'', {{nihongo4|[[List of Kamen Rider Blade characters#Hajime Aikawa|Hajime Aikawa]]|\u76f8\u5ddd \u59cb|Aikawa Hajime}}, whose true identity is the original {{nihongo4|Black Joker Undead|\u9ed2\u3044\u30b8\u30e7\u30ab\u30fc\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c8|Kuroi Jok\u0101 Andetto}}, or simply known as {{nihongo4|Joker|\u30b8\u30e7\u30ab\u30fc|Jok\u0101}}; the most feared of the Undead as he can assume the form of defeated Undead and because his victory in the Battle Fight would mark the end of all life on Earth.

Hajime's time at the Jacaranda Cafe with Kurihara's daughter, Amane, helped him accept humanity to the point of wishing he was truly human himself while growing to respect Kazuma. Eventually, Hajime's identity as the Joker is revealed and he eventually loses control over his powers once the other Undead are sealed. Hajime is forced to fight Kazuma before realizing the human is turning himself into an Undead to force the current Battle Fight into a stalemate. Knowing they would be forced by the Battle Fight's overseer into fighting each other, Kazuma leaves Japan so Hajime can live happily with Kurihara's family.\n\nEven in spite of Another Blade's creation, Hajime retains his powers due to his Joker nature. After attempting to save Amane from Sougo, he is attacked by Kazuma, who considered Hajime's actions an apparent betrayal of his trust. When Amane was forced into becoming Another Blade again by White Woz, she rendered Hajime completely human by extracting and absorbing his Undead D.N.A.

One particular member disguised itself as the late Shun Kageyama to win Yaguruma over to their cause. Additionally, due to a space-time disruption, knowledge of the Shibuya Meteorite incident and ZECT's existence have been wiped out, with only the majority of surviving ZECT Riders like Kagami, especially Yaguruma remembering them.

This particular Chase came to Sougo's world after the Drive Ridewatch was destroyed, leading an army of numberless Roidmudes and numerous other monster grunts.

That proposed by Monsenhor Jo\u00e3o Gaspar stands out: Iscaria meant \"outeiro\", a rocky elevation above Ribeira, the place where now stands the pavilion of Clube do Povo de Esgueira, formerly \"Parque do Outeiro\".\n\nIts geographic location, alongside tidal flats, permitted, until the 17th century, the development of the salt industry.<ref name=JFHistoria/> An active centre in salt commerce, Esqueira was the seat of its jurisdiction (over thirty 31 towns and 10 municipalities).<ref name=JFHistoria/> It received a [[foral]] (''charter'') in 1110 from the Count Henrique.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nIn 1116, the Monastery of Lorv\u00e3o had possessions in the town, which the Afonso Henriques enlarged in 1176, with the donation of Taboeira, among others.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nIt was [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] that in October 1210, provided Esgueira to his daughter D.

elevation of Aveiro to city, the lands were converted into crown lands, after the Dukes implicated in the attempted assassination of [[Joseph I of Portugal]] were executed: the privileges of the Dukes were removed, and transferred by 6 November 1836 decree, extinguishing the municipality and annexxing Esgueira (as a simple parish) to the municipality of Aveiro.<ref

Quinta do Sim\u00e3o, Matadu\u00e7os and Pa\u00e7o.\n\nEsgueira is a relatively young residential population.\n\nEsgueira has an annual population of approximately 3050 students, distributed among five [[kindergarten]]/primary schools (including ''EB1/JI Taboeira'', ''EB1/JI Esgueira'', ''EB1/JI Alumieira'', ''EB1/JI Quinta do Sim\u00e3o'' and ''Cabo Lu\u00eds/Bela Vista''), one middle-school

That proposed by Monsenhor Jo\u00e3o Gaspar stands out: Iscaria meant \"outeiro\", a rocky elevation above Ribeira, the place where now stands the pavilion of Clube do Povo de Esgueira, formerly \"Parque do Outeiro\".\n\nIts geographic location, alongside tidal flats, permitted, until the 17th century, the development of the salt industry.<ref name=JFHistoria/> An active centre in salt commerce, Esqueira was the seat of its jurisdiction (over thirty 31 towns and 10 municipalities).<ref name=JFHistoria/> It received a [[foral]] (''charter'') in 1110 from the Count Henrique.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nIn 1116, the Monastery of Lorv\u00e3o had possessions in the town, which the Afonso Henriques enlarged in 1176, with the donation of Taboeira, among others.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nIt was [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] that in October 1210, provided Esgueira to his daughter D. Teresa in his testament.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nOn 8 June 1515, a new foral was issued by [[Manuel I of Portugal]].<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nDuring the reign of [[John III of Portugal|John III]] there was a reorganization of the territorial divisions of the kingdom, resulting in the establishment of new comarcas, including Esgueira on 20 December 1533. Between 1528 and 1836, Esgueira was a municipality, consisting of the parishes of Esgueira, Cacia, Nariz and Palha\u00e7a, whom, by 1801, included 4426 inhabitants.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nWith the elevation of Aveiro to city, the lands were converted into crown lands, after the Dukes implicated in the attempted assassination of [[Joseph I of Portugal]] were executed: the privileges of the Dukes were removed, and transferred by 6 November 1836 decree, extinguishing the municipality and annexxing Esgueira (as a simple parish) to the municipality of Aveiro.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\n==Geography==\nThe civil parish consists of various localities, including: Senhor do \u00c1lamo/Cruzeiro, Bairro do Vouga, Agras do Norte, Cabo Lu\u00eds, Bela Vista, Taboeira, Quinta do Sim\u00e3o, Matadu\u00e7os and Pa\u00e7o.\n\nEsgueira is a relatively young residential population.\n\nEsgueira has an annual population of approximately 3050 students, distributed among five [[kindergarten]]/primary schools (including ''EB1/JI Taboeira'', ''EB1/JI Esgueira'', ''EB1/JI Alumieira'', ''EB1/JI Quinta do Sim\u00e3o'' and ''Cabo Lu\u00eds/Bela Vista''), one middle-school (''Escola B\u00e1sica 2\u00ba/3\u00ba Ciclos Aires Barbosa''), and a secondary school (''Escola Secund\u00e1ria Jaime Magalh\u00e3es Lima'').\n\nWhile the community strives to establish a health centre, it is served by a health outpost on the ground floor of the municipal hall, in addition to a center for handicapped rehabilitation, medical clinics, two dental clinics, two pharmacies, a center for clinical analysis and centre for surgery.\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Civic===\n* '''Residence of Carvoeira''' ({{lang|pt|Casa da Carvoeira/Casa da Cultura de Esgueira}})<ref
