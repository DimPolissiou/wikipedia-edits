The client, used by end users to interact with the system, is a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] application that typically connects directly through a router provided by Bloomberg and installed on-site. End users can also make use of an extra service (''Bloomberg Anywhere'') to allow the Windows application to connect via internet/IP, or Web access via a [[Citrix]] client. There are also applications that allow mobile access via [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. The server side of the terminal was originally developed using mostly the [[programming language]]s [[Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]. Recent years have seen a transition towards [[C++]] and embedded [[JavaScript]] on the clients and servers. Also, the usage of languages like [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[TypeScript]] has increased.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nEach server machine runs multiple instances of the server process. Using a proprietary form of context-switching, the servers keep track of the state of each end user, allowing consecutive interactions from a single user to be handled by different server processes. The [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) code is also proprietary.\n\n== Keyboard ==\n[[Michael Bloomberg]]'s 1997 autobiography contains a chapter entitled ''Computers for Virgins'', which explains the differences in the design of the terminal and its keyboard from the standard IBM [[PC keyboard]] layout that was popular at that time. The terminal's keyboard layout was designed for traders and market makers who had no prior computer experience. The look and feel of the Bloomberg keyboard are similar to an ordinary computer keyboard, with several enhancements which help users navigate through the system.\n\nKeyboard keys are commonly referred to inside angle brackets with full commands being contained in curly brackets\u200a e.g., {VOD LN {{key press|Equity}} {{key press|GO}}}. The function key names and then-standard beige colour of an ordinary keyboard were changed from the technical name, e.g., F10, to a memorable colour and name, e.g., ''Yellow''. The F10 key is thus a ''Yellow'' key named {{key press|Index}}. The {{key press|Esc}} is coloured red and named {{key press|Cancel}} in the Bloomberg system, with the red to catch one's eye to stop a task. The {{key press|Enter}} key is referred to as {{key press|GO}} with a green color, deriving from the ''Monopoly'' game board, by passing ''Go'' and collecting $200 in a hope that the user could make money on the information he would find.<ref>''Bloomberg by Bloomberg'', Michael R. Bloomberg 1997</ref>\n\nThe Bloomberg keyboard includes a unique {{key press|Menu}} key which navigates back to the previous function used.  If no previous commands are found, {{key press|Menu}} displays a list of related functions.  Similarly, the {{key press|History}} key will populate the command-line with previously used functions in reverse chronological order, as the {{key press|Up}} key function does in certain command prompts.\n\nThe yellow hotkeys along the top of the keyboard are used to enter market sectors, and are generally used as suffixes to allow the terminal to correctly identify a security.\n[[File:Bloomberg terminal keyboard.jpg|thumb|An early 2000s Bloomberg terminal keyboard]]\n\n* F2 GOVT \u2013 government securities (U.S. treasury and non-U.S.)\n* F3 CORP \u2013 corporate debt\n* F4 MTGE \u2013 mortgage securities\n* F5 M-Mkt \u2013 money market\n* F6 MUNI \u2013 municipal debt\n* F7 PFD \u2013 preferred shares\n* F8 EQUITY \u2013 equity shares\n* F9 COMDTY \u2013 commodity markets\n* F10 INDEX \u2013 indexes\n* F11 CURNCY \u2013 currency markets\n* F12 CLIENT/ALPHA \u2013 portfolio functionality\n\nFor example, if someone is interested in the Vodafone stock listed in the London market, one enters {<kbd>VOD</kbd> <kbd>LN</kbd> {{key press|Equity}} {{key press|GO}}} where VOD is the company's [[ticker symbol]], LN is the venue code for London, and {{key press|Equity}} is the market sector. A detailed option list related to Vodafone UK stock will pop up, the person can then choose different options by pressing related keys or using the mouse to select the option.\n\nSimilarly, {<kbd>USDEUR</kbd> {{key press|Curncy}} {{key press|GO}}} displays the U.S. dollar\u2013[[Euro]] [[exchange rate|exchange]] [[spot rate]].\n\nOther common Bloomberg commands for Equity include:\n\n* {HP <GO>} \u2013 Historical Price \u2013 Display the detailed historical price of the currently loaded stock\n* {DVD <GO>} \u2013 Dividend / Split Summary of the currently loaded stock\n* {CACS <GO>} \u2013 [[Corporate action|Corporate Actions]] related to the currently loaded stock\n* {CN <GO>} \u2013 Company News \u2013 News related to the currently loaded stock\n\nThus, if someone interested in the historical Vodafone UK stock price, they can directly type in {<kbd>VOD</kbd> <kbd>LN</kbd> <Equity> <kbd>HP</kbd> <GO>}.\n\nThe Bloomberg keyboard has traditionally been heavier and sturdier than standard keyboards (a previous version, the SEA100 Bloomberg keyboard weighed around 3&nbsp;kg) with 3mm key travel and 19mm key pitch; it also comes with built-in speakers for multimedia features. The SEA100 version has a built-in, 500 PPI, 0.26 sq inch biometric sensor for user login verification.  The current Starboard (Keyboard 4) version is 1.08&nbsp;kg and uses flatter, chiclet-style keys which are quieter and have less key travel than Freeboard (Keyboard 3) and prior.\n{{Bloomberg keys}}\n\n== Terminal and related products ==\nSelf-contained operating system running on custom hardware\u2014commonly referred to as a ''Bloomberg Box''<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lowry |first=Tom |title=The Bloomberg Machine |newspaper=[[BusinessWeek]] |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=April 23, 2001 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_17/b3729001.htm |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022082539/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_17/b3729001.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>\u2014the Bloomberg Terminal now functions as an application within the Windows environment.  From a user's perspective, there are essentially 3 distinct levels to the system:\n\n=== Core Terminal ===\n''Core Terminal'' refers to the original Bloomberg system; typically consisting of four windows, or ''Panels'', each Panel contains a separate instance of the terminal command line. As the user enters tickers and functions, they can call up and display the real-time data of the market, with each different screen simultaneously running a program to analyze other tickers, functions, values and markets in real time.  This use of multiple screens with user-demanded, specific pieces of differing data\u2014across all relevant markets\u2014allows the user to view diverse and countless volumes of information in real-time.  Accessing market data, as it develops, allows the user to make trades and investments in all markets across the world, without having any lag in information.  Users can run all four windows on a single monitor or spread them out amongst many monitors, maximizing the information shown on each, to effectually create up to four terminals.\n\nIn February 2012, Bloomberg LP publicly announced an upgrade to the Terminal called ''Bloomberg NEXT''. The stated goals of this multi-year, $100 million project were to improve the discoverability and usability of the Core Terminal's functionality, making it easier and more intuitive to use.<ref>{{cite news|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|title=Bloomberg to reveal data service redesign|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f429986-6093-11e1-af75-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=April 15, 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=February 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402213845/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f429986-6093-11e1-af75-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Launchpad ===\nLaunchpad is a customizable display consisting of a number of smaller windows, called ''components'', each dedicated to permanently displaying one set of data. A typical user would be a stockbroker who wishes to keep a list of 30 stocks visible at all times: Launchpad allows the user to create a small component which will show these prices constantly, saving the user from having to check each stock independently in the 4 terminal windows. To turn on Launchpad the command {BLP <GO>} is used, {PDFB<GO>} allows users to set Lpad to open automatically on login. Older keyboards had an <Lpad> key which replicated the {BLP<GO>} command. Other functions, such as email inboxes, calculation tools and news tickers can be similarly displayed. The Instant Bloomberg messaging/chat tool is a Launchpad component, as are the chat windows it creates. To launch a normal function from the Bloomberg Terminal's 4 Screens into launchpad type {LLP<GO>} from the target screen you wish to turn into a launchpad item.\n\n=== Application programming interface ===\nThe Bloomberg Open API (BLPAPI) [[application programming interface]] (API) allows [[Third-party software component|third-party]] applications, such as [[Microsoft Excel]], to access Bloomberg data via the Terminal and Bloomberg's market data products. A user might wish to use Bloomberg data from the Terminal to create their own calculations; by accessing streaming, historical, and reference market data from another program, they can build these formulae. The Bloomberg Terminal installation ships with Excel add-ins which facilitate building spreadsheets which consume market data.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloomberg Software Support|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/software_support/|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=May 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517004815/http://www.bloomberg.com/professional/software_support/|archive-date=May 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, Bloomberg offers free BLPAPI SDKs allowing Bloomberg subscribers to build their own software which accesses market data in [[Wolfram Language]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].<ref name=open_api>{{cite web |title=Open API |url=http://www.openbloomberg.com/open-api/ |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512182932/http://www.openbloomberg.com/open-api/ |archivedate=May 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n== Competitors ==\n{{Details|Financial data vendor}}\nThe largest competitor to the Bloomberg terminal is [[Thomson Reuters]] with its [[Reuters 3000 Xtra]] system, which was replaced by [[Eikon]] platform in 2010, with Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters splitting 30% each of the market share in 2011.

Recent years have seen a transition towards [[C++]] and embedded [[JavaScript]] on the clients and servers. Also, the usage of languages like [[Python]] and [[TypeScript]] has increased.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nEach server machine runs multiple instances of the server process. Using a proprietary form of context-switching, the servers keep track of the state of each end user, allowing consecutive interactions from a single user to be handled by different server processes. The [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) code is also proprietary.\n\n== Keyboard ==\n[[Michael Bloomberg]]'s 1997 autobiography contains a chapter entitled ''Computers for Virgins'', which explains the differences in the design of the terminal and its keyboard from the standard IBM [[PC keyboard]] layout that was popular at that time. The terminal's keyboard layout was designed for traders and market makers who had no prior computer experience. The look and feel of the Bloomberg keyboard are similar to an ordinary computer keyboard, with several enhancements which help users navigate through the system.\n\nKeyboard keys are commonly referred to inside angle brackets with full commands being contained in curly brackets\u200a e.g., {VOD LN {{key press|Equity}} {{key press|GO}}}. The function key names and then-standard beige colour of an ordinary keyboard were changed from the technical name, e.g., F10, to a memorable colour and name, e.g., ''Yellow''. The F10 key is thus a ''Yellow'' key named {{key press|Index}}. The {{key press|Esc}} is coloured red and named {{key press|Cancel}} in the Bloomberg system, with the red to catch one's eye to stop a task. The {{key press|Enter}} key is referred to as {{key press|GO}} with a green color, deriving from the ''Monopoly'' game board, by passing ''Go'' and collecting $200 in a hope that the user could make money on the information he would find.<ref>''Bloomberg by Bloomberg'', Michael R. Bloomberg 1997</ref>\n\nThe Bloomberg keyboard includes a unique {{key press|Menu}} key which navigates back to the previous function used.  If no previous commands are found, {{key press|Menu}} displays a list of related functions.  Similarly, the {{key press|History}} key will populate the command-line with previously used functions in reverse chronological order, as the {{key press|Up}} key function does in certain command prompts.\n\nThe yellow hotkeys along the top of the keyboard are used to enter market sectors, and are generally used as suffixes to allow the terminal to correctly identify a security.\n[[File:Bloomberg terminal keyboard.jpg|thumb|An early 2000s Bloomberg terminal keyboard]]\n\n* F2 GOVT \u2013 government securities (U.S. treasury and non-U.S.)\n* F3 CORP \u2013 corporate debt\n* F4 MTGE \u2013 mortgage securities\n* F5 M-Mkt \u2013 money market\n* F6 MUNI \u2013 municipal debt\n* F7 PFD \u2013 preferred shares\n* F8 EQUITY \u2013 equity shares\n* F9 COMDTY \u2013 commodity markets\n* F10 INDEX \u2013 indexes\n* F11 CURNCY \u2013 currency markets\n* F12 CLIENT/ALPHA \u2013 portfolio functionality\n\nFor example, if someone is interested in the Vodafone stock listed in the London market, one enters {<kbd>VOD</kbd> <kbd>LN</kbd> {{key press|Equity}} {{key press|GO}}} where VOD is the company's [[ticker symbol]], LN is the venue code for London, and {{key press|Equity}} is the market sector. A detailed option list related to Vodafone UK stock will pop up, the person can then choose different options by pressing related keys or using the mouse to select the option.\n\nSimilarly, {<kbd>USDEUR</kbd> {{key press|Curncy}} {{key press|GO}}} displays the U.S. dollar\u2013[[Euro]] [[exchange rate|exchange]] [[spot rate]].\n\nOther common Bloomberg commands for Equity include:\n\n* {HP <GO>} \u2013 Historical Price \u2013 Display the detailed historical price of the currently loaded stock\n* {DVD <GO>} \u2013 Dividend / Split Summary of the currently loaded stock\n* {CACS <GO>} \u2013 [[Corporate action|Corporate Actions]] related to the currently loaded stock\n* {CN <GO>} \u2013 Company News \u2013 News related to the currently loaded stock\n\nThus, if someone interested in the historical Vodafone UK stock price, they can directly type in {<kbd>VOD</kbd> <kbd>LN</kbd> <Equity> <kbd>HP</kbd> <GO>}.\n\nThe Bloomberg keyboard has traditionally been heavier and sturdier than standard keyboards (a previous version, the SEA100 Bloomberg keyboard weighed around 3&nbsp;kg) with 3mm key travel and 19mm key pitch; it also comes with built-in speakers for multimedia features. The SEA100 version has a built-in, 500 PPI, 0.26 sq inch biometric sensor for user login verification.  The current Starboard (Keyboard 4) version is 1.08&nbsp;kg and uses flatter, chiclet-style keys which are quieter and have less key travel than Freeboard (Keyboard 3) and prior.\n{{Bloomberg keys}}\n\n== Terminal and related products ==\nSelf-contained operating system running on custom hardware\u2014commonly referred to as a ''Bloomberg Box''<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lowry |first=Tom |title=The Bloomberg Machine |newspaper=[[BusinessWeek]] |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=April 23, 2001 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_17/b3729001.htm |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022082539/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_17/b3729001.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>\u2014the Bloomberg Terminal now functions as an application within the Windows environment.  From a user's perspective, there are essentially 3 distinct levels to the system:\n\n=== Core Terminal ===\n''Core Terminal'' refers to the original Bloomberg system; typically consisting of four windows, or ''Panels'', each Panel contains a separate instance of the terminal command line. As the user enters tickers and functions, they can call up and display the real-time data of the market, with each different screen simultaneously running a program to analyze other tickers, functions, values and markets in real time.  This use of multiple screens with user-demanded, specific pieces of differing data\u2014across all relevant markets\u2014allows the user to view diverse and countless volumes of information in real-time.  Accessing market data, as it develops, allows the user to make trades and investments in all markets across the world, without having any lag in information.  Users can run all four windows on a single monitor or spread them out amongst many monitors, maximizing the information shown on each, to effectually create up to four terminals.\n\nIn February 2012, Bloomberg LP publicly announced an upgrade to the Terminal called ''Bloomberg NEXT''. The stated goals of this multi-year, $100 million project were to improve the discoverability and usability of the Core Terminal's functionality, making it easier and more intuitive to use.<ref>{{cite news|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|title=Bloomberg to reveal data service redesign|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f429986-6093-11e1-af75-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=April 15, 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=February 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402213845/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f429986-6093-11e1-af75-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Launchpad ===\nLaunchpad is a customizable display consisting of a number of smaller windows, called ''components'', each dedicated to permanently displaying one set of data. A typical user would be a stockbroker who wishes to keep a list of 30 stocks visible at all times: Launchpad allows the user to create a small component which will show these prices constantly, saving the user from having to check each stock independently in the 4 terminal windows. To turn on Launchpad the command {BLP <GO>} is used, {PDFB<GO>} allows users to set Lpad to open automatically on login. Older keyboards had an <Lpad> key which replicated the {BLP<GO>} command. Other functions, such as email inboxes, calculation tools and news tickers can be similarly displayed. The Instant Bloomberg messaging/chat tool is a Launchpad component, as are the chat windows it creates. To launch a normal function from the Bloomberg Terminal's 4 Screens into launchpad type {LLP<GO>} from the target screen you wish to turn into a launchpad item.\n\n=== Application programming interface ===\nThe Bloomberg Open API (BLPAPI) [[application programming interface]] (API) allows [[Third-party software component|third-party]] applications, such as [[Microsoft Excel]], to access Bloomberg data via the Terminal and Bloomberg's market data products. A user might wish to use Bloomberg data from the Terminal to create their own calculations; by accessing streaming, historical, and reference market data from another program, they can build these formulae. The Bloomberg Terminal installation ships with Excel add-ins which facilitate building spreadsheets which consume market data.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloomberg Software Support|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/software_support/|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=May 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517004815/http://www.bloomberg.com/professional/software_support/|archive-date=May 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, Bloomberg offers free BLPAPI SDKs allowing Bloomberg subscribers to build their own software which accesses market data in [[Wolfram Language]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].<ref name=open_api>{{cite web |title=Open API |url=http://www.openbloomberg.com/open-api/ |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512182932/http://www.openbloomberg.com/open-api/ |archivedate=May 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n== Competitors ==\n{{Details|Financial data vendor}}\nThe largest competitor to the Bloomberg terminal is [[Thomson Reuters]] with its [[Reuters 3000 Xtra]] system, which was replaced by [[Eikon]] platform in 2010, with Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters splitting 30% each of the market share in 2011.

He was the youngest child of a family that lived on a modest working ranch near the hamlet of [[Lometa]], Texas. The first week of August, 1952, Joyce [[Blauvelt]] Hightower gave birth to her third child on a Monday. On Wednesday of the same week, she was diagnosed with polio.

The poems move through cultural highs and lows. Of the book, [[Marie Ponsot]] wrote, \"The most exciting quality of Hightower\u2019s work is its poetic and paradoxical unifying of emotional and intellectual depth with a marvelous quietness. Its lively incidents and anecdotes are grounded, rooted, in meditative awareness.\"\n \nIn \"Natural Trouble,\" the theme of inheritance extends through changes of landscape and bad weather.

The character became something of an institution, so much so that grumpy old men were sometimes nicknamed \"Albert Tatlock\".\n\nA veteran of the First World War, Albert settled back into civilian life by marrying and starting a family, however his wife Bessie died in 1959 and he retired from his job at the Town Hall the following year, taking up a new occupation as the street's resident grumpy old man, forever complaining about the struggles of old age and living on the low income from his pension.\n\nAlthough Albert was never close to his daughter Beattie, he maintained close ties with his brother Alfred's family, particularly his niece Valerie, who married Albert's neighbour [[Ken Barlow]] in 1962. With Val's death in 1971, and Beattie's continued absence, Ken eventually moved into No. 1 and took care of Albert in his twilight years until his death in May 1984.\n\n==Storylines==\n\nAlbert was delighted when his niece [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie]] ([[Anne Reid]]), daughter of his brother Alfred, came to stay with him, and began seeing neighbour [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]); and even more so when the pair got married in 1962. Albert was pleased to have family ties in the street and he was a frequent visitor at No. 9.\n\nNot idle in his retirement, Albert got a job as a [[school]] crossing warden and hired an allotment from the Council to grow his own vegetables. In 1965, Albert asked [[Clara Midgeley]] (Betty Hardy) to look after his house while he went for an extended visit to his daughter [[Beattie Pearson]]'s ([[Gabrielle Daye]]), and upon his return he soon realised Clara was interested in him. Clara proposed to Albert but he turned her down, saying he was too set in his ways.\n\nMoney was always a great concern of Albert's. In 1967, he briefly bought items in bulk with [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]) to cut costs and later took a live-in assistant job at the Fusiliers' Museum, working for his old friend Harry Dunscombe. [[Effie Spicer]] (Anne Dyson) looked after No. 1 while Albert was living elsewhere. Effie left the house abruptly upon Albert's return as he had increased her rent because he hated the decorating she had done as a surprise for him.\n\nIn 1969, Albert found himself warming to the idea of remarrying, so he would have someone to spend his old age with. He proposed to Alice Pickins ([[Doris Hare]]), who had been pursuing him for nearly a year, however as the guests assembled for the wedding, the vicar was delayed, and Alice thought it was a bad sign and decided not to marry Albert after all. Further upset came for Albert in 1971 when Ken and Valerie decided to emigrate. Just as he was coming to terms with their departure, Valerie died in an accident in the Barlows' maisonette, and a distraught Ken decided to stay in the country. Even though Ken was not a blood relative, Albert had come to accept him as part of his family and eventually let him lodge at No. 1 although he made clear his disapproval that Ken had decided to send his and Val's twins [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter]] and [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] (Robert and Katie Heaneu) to live in Scotland with Val's parents, Alfred and [[List of Coronation Street characters (1969)#Edith Tatlock|Edith Tatlock]] ([[Clare Kelly]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Albert's financial woes continued. He took a job as co-caretaker at the local Community Centre and in 1973 suggested to friend [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]) that they marry for financial reasons (Minnie was also struggling with money). After months of being engaged, Minnie pressed Albert to set a date for the wedding. However, when her friend Ena pointed out that as a couple they would earn less than they would separately, Minnie called off the engagement. Both were relieved, as they were starting to get on each other's nerves.\n\nAlbert celebrated his 80th birthday in August 1975. To his surprise, the neighbours threw a surprise party for him. They had contacted his old regiment who sent along a bugler. In 1976, Albert had a dispute when he won money at the bingo with Bertha Lumley ([[Madoline Thomas]]), as she did not share her winnings with him despite their agreement. Albert was threatened by Bertha's husband Nat ([[Eric Longworth]]), so he decided to leave well alone.\n\nAlbert was very proud of his war record, and took a dim view of Minnie's friend Handel Gartside ([[Harry Markham]]) when he found out he was a conscientious objector, and even at one point refused to let Handel in his house. In 1980, Albert sold his Military Medal to go to London for [[Remembrance Day]], to pay tribute to his war friend Monty Shawcross. When Ken saw how upset Albert was that he had sold his medal, he bought it back for him.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Albert spent his days taking care of his allotment, though he feared the Council would take it off him because of his age. Ken had married again but was now back at No. 1 after being widowed. However, in 1981, Ken married for a third time, to [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]). Ken and Deirdre planned to move although Ken felt an obligation to take care of Albert, as Albert's daughter Beattie continued to visit him only a few times a year. Albert wanted to stay in No. 1 but knew that if he left the house to Ken and Deirdre in his will it would upset Beattie, so the Barlows decided to buy it from him instead (although Beattie was still upset by the news). Albert agreed to move into the front parlour so that Deirdre's daughter [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy]] (Holly Chamarette) could take his room.\n\nAlbert Tatlock died in his sleep on 13 May 1984, aged 88, while visiting Beattie. His death mirrored the real life death of the actor who played him, Jack Howarth, who had died in hospital six weeks earlier. In 2014, Albert's medal featured in a further storyline, when Tracy sold it. Deirdre was furious and demanded she get it back or else she would kick her out of No. 1.\n\nIn January 2019, Ken's long-lost son [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] ([[Rob Mallard]]) and his wife [[Sinead Tinker|Sinead]] ([[Katie McGlynn]]) had a baby boy whom they named [[Bertie Osbourne|Bertie]], after Albert.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Personality and identity===\nTo those that did not know him, Albert could be perceived as a very bitter person, as he was constantly complaining about nearly every aspect of his life, and seemed to think that his problems amounted to more than anyone else's, however trivial they were. Although he was never chatty or chirpy, in the 1960s Albert was more accepting of the troubles life threw at him, however as the years went by as Albert became more set in his ways he became grumpier, sounding off about his problems to anyone who tried to engage him in conversation.\n\nTo his family and closest friends, as well as anyone willing to indulge him in recollections of his war stories, Albert showed a softer side. Although a pessimist, he was also nostalgic, and easily grew attached to things that were important to him. Unfortunately, this occasionally manifested itself through stubbornness, especially in family matters, as he tended to think he knew what was best for people and would not hesitate to tell them, even if he knew they disagreed with him. Likewise, when let down by his family, he was prone to feeling sorry for himself until his indignation was validated.\n\n===Community involvement===\nDespite his advancing years, Albert was very active in the community in Coronation Street, acting as Chairman of the Over 60s Club in 1961, organising an Over 60s bazaar in 1964 and a trip to the Preston Guild in 1972.\n\nIn 1962, he formed the Mission Hall Players, through which the residents performed in pantomime in Lady Lawson Loses in the Mission, with Albert himself playing the role of Manders. Almost without exception, Albert participated in all subsequent plays performed in the Mission and Community Centre, playing Baron Hardup (panto), the Genie (Aladdin), and Baron (Cinderella), as well as Rob Wilton in a 40s show in the Rovers and reciting \"The Girl I Kissed on the Stairs\" at a Christmas concert.\n\nHaving worked at the Town Hall, Albert was also pressed into action by the residents for several causes, including investigating the possibility of Coronation Street being demolished. He also started a petition to stop the street being renamed. Albert also served the community by working as Caretaker at the Mission after Ena Sharples lost the job in 1961, even though the job required him to move out of his beloved No.1 and into the Mission vestry. He later gave up the job so that Ena could be reinstated.\n\n===Family and friends===\nAlbert was closest to those who took the time to visit him. His daughter Beattie rarely did so, usually turning up only when she was needed. Albert did not feel close to her and refused his Doctor's recommendations that he moved in with Beattie and her husband Norman Pearson, as he knew they did not want him and so he would never be at home. Beattie liked to think of herself as the perfect daughter to Albert, and overcompensated for her inactive role in his life during her fleeting visits, such as when she guilted Jerry Booth into paying \u00a35 compensation when Albert was gassed by a faulty cooper fitted by Jerry, Albert having made clear that he did not want compensation.\nHis best friends in Coronation Street were the Barlow family, who lived next door at No.3. Both Ken and David Barlow were frequent visitors at No.1, with Ken in particular seeking solace in Albert's house when he needed to get away from family pressures. Albert could not have been happier when Ken married his niece Valerie. After a while, Ken even started to call Albert \"Uncle Albert\" as Val did. Albert thought of the Barlows as his extended family, and was upset when David married Irma Ogden while he was away, as he had not wanted to miss the wedding.\n\nKen lived with Albert for periods during the 1970s and from 1976 onwards. As Ken tried to forge a new life after Val's death, Albert was very critical of his decisions, especially those relating to his love life, as he did not think any girl was worthy of following Val. He eventually gave his approval of Ken's overnight marriage to Janet Reid, and he was upset when they separated. It took a long time for Albert to warm to Deirdre Langton, as he resented the fact that she had a daughter from a previous marriage who Ken was spending more time with than his own children, however he later changed his mind and encouraged them to live at No.1 when they got married.\n\nEven over those of his own father Frank Barlow, Ken recalls Albert's words when he recounts the fatherly advice he received in the past. A photograph of Albert remains on the mantelpiece at No.1.\n\nAlbert's closest friends in Coronation Street were Rovers landlady Annie Walker and landlord Jack, Mission caretaker Ena Sharples and one-time fianc\u00e9 Minnie Caldwell. All four friendships lasted decades and they were among the few people who indulged Albert when he was on a tirade.\n\n===Hobbies and interests===\nAlbert's main topics of conversation were the war and his allotment. He enjoyed nothing more than talking about old times and especially old battles. In 1968, when he believed the author of a book about the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Lys]] got his facts wrong, he planned to expose him, until it was discovered that Albert had got lost while out on patrol and missed the battle himself. In 1971, [[BBC Manchester]] interviewed Albert about the war.\n\nAlbert's allotment provided something to do in his later years. When he feared the Council was going to take it off him, the neighbours agreed to help out, although he was furious when Ray Langton carved \"Albert rules OK\" into his marrow. Further, salad from his allotment was the cause of a sickness in the street when it was sold at the Corner Shop in 1978.\n\nAlbert was also a cricket fan, and hoped to go see the West Indies team play. A rum drinker, his catch phrases in the \"Rovers Return\"  were \"I'll have a rum.\" and \"Eeh by gum.\"\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n=== Music ===\n\n* Albert Tatlock is referenced mulitiple times in the song ''\"TV Stars\" by [[Skids (band)|The Skids]] (1979).''\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Coronation Street characters|past}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tatlock, Albert}}\n[[Category:Coronation Street characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1960]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional World War I veterans]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2009}}\n{{In-universe|date=February 2011}}\n}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=[[Coronation Street]]\n| name = Albert Tatlock\n| portrayer = [[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]\n| image = Albert Tatlock.jpg\n| imagesize = 200px\n| years   = 1960\u20131984\n| first      = [[Episode 1 (Coronation Street)|Episode 1]]<br>9 December 1960\n| last       = Episode 2381<br>25 January 1984\n| born       = 10 August 1895\n| death      = 13 May 1984\n| father     = William Tatlock\n| mother    = Emmeline Tatlock\n| brothers  = Alfred Tatlock\n| nieces = Joyce Tatlock<br>[[Valerie Barlow]] \n| wife     = Bessie Vickery (1919-59)\n| daughters   = [[Beattie Pearson]]\n| aunts = Mary Osbourne<br>[[List of Coronation Street characters (1969)#Ada Broadbent|Ada Broadbent]]\n| uncles = Horace Duckworth\n| grandfathers = Alfred Tatlock\n| grandmothers = Louisa Tatlock\n| relatives = [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]]<br>[[Susan Barlow]]\n| occupation = Town Hall clerk (retired)\n| creator = [[Tony Warren]]\n| introducer = [[Stuart Latham]]\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#T|Former; regular]]\n| books = ''Coronation Street:<br> The Complete Saga<br>Coronation Street:<br> Keeping The Home Fires Burning<br>Coronation Street:<br> The War Years''\n}}\n'''Albert Tatlock''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[United Kingdom|British]] television [[soap opera]] ''[[Coronation Street]]''.

He has also competed for the [[Mexican national baseball team]] in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|2006]], [[2009 World Baseball Classic|2009]], and [[2013 World Baseball Classic]]s.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===San Diego Padres===\nP\u00e9rez was signed by the [[San Diego Padres]] as an amateur free agent in 1999. He made his debut with the Padres in {{baseball year|2002}}. P\u00e9rez did well for a [[rookie]] after being called up by the Padres in 2002, striking out over a batter per inning, but he suffered from control issues at times.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} He regressed somewhat in {{baseball year|2003}}.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates===\nIn August 2003, P\u00e9rez was sent by San Diego to Pittsburgh along with [[Jason Bay]] and [[Cory Stewart]] in exchange for [[Brian Giles]].\n\nBefore the {{baseball year|2004}} season, the team overhauled his pitching mechanics. His average of 10.97 [[strikeouts per nine innings]] was highest in the Majors (239 SO/196 IP); his 2.98 ERA was fifth in the [[National League]] (tied with [[Roger Clemens]]); and his 12\u201310 record could have been ever better with reasonable run support early in the season. Pirates' bats provided two or fewer runs in P\u00e9rez' 16 starts before [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] break, causing him to post a 5\u20134 record with five no decisions despite a 3.24 ERA. In that season, P\u00e9rez pitched at least six innings and allowed three or fewer runs in 21 of his 30 starts (70%). Through this first three seasons, P\u00e9rez had compiled a 20\u201325 record with 474 [[strikeout]]s and a 3.86 [[Earned run average|ERA]] in 412.2 [[innings pitched|innings]]. His 239 strikeouts that year are currently the third-most in a season by a modern-day Pirate, trailing only [[Bob Veale]]'s 276 in {{Baseball year|1965}} and 250 in {{Baseball year|1964}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nBy contrast, P\u00e9rez's {{baseball year|2005}} season was disappointing. He posted a 5.85 ERA in a season plagued by injuries. The Pirates were forced to place him on the [[disabled list]] on June 29 after he broke his toe kicking a cart following a loss to St. Louis. He missed two and a half months, returning in September to post a 4.58 ERA in 19.2 late season innings. P\u00e9rez had also lost significant speed off his fastball.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nP\u00e9rez represented Mexico in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|inaugural]] [[World Baseball Classic]], where Mexico was eliminated in the second group stage.<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 World Baseball Classic - Results|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/2006_World_Baseball_Classic#Round_Two|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2006 World Baseball Classic (Rosters)|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/2006_World_Baseball_Classic_(Rosters)#Mexico|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, P\u00e9rez opened the Pirates' season as the number one starter. On June 27, P\u00e9rez was sent to the Pirates bullpen after struggling through the first half of the season with an ERA over 6.00. On June 29, he was sent to the Triple-A [[Indianapolis Indians]], with [[Tom Gorzelanny]] being called up to replace him in the starting rotation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rutter|first1=Joe|title=Perez sent down to Triple-A|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/pirates/s_460142.html|website=Trib Live|publisher=Trib Total Media, Inc.|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===New York Mets===\n[[File:\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez on October 3, 2010.jpg|250px|thumb|P\u00e9rez pitching for the [[2010 New York Mets season|New York Mets in 2010]]]]\nOn July 31, 2006, P\u00e9rez and [[Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez (relief pitcher)|Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez]] were traded to the [[New York Mets]] in exchange for [[Xavier Nady]]. The Mets assigned P\u00e9rez to their AAA affiliate, the [[Norfolk Tides]]. He was recalled to the Mets' major league roster on August 26, 2006. After two subpar starts, P\u00e9rez threw a complete game shutout against the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] on September 6.<ref>{{cite web|title=September 6, 2006, Atlanta Braves at New York Mets Play by Play and Box Score|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN200609062.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Mets lost two starting pitchers to injury in the final week before the playoffs started, they were forced to use P\u00e9rez in the playoff rotation. His first playoff start came in Game 4 of the NLCS, in which he picked up his first career postseason win. His second playoff start came in [[2006 National League Championship Series#Game 7|Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS]] vs. the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]]. He pitched six innings in, allowing one [[Earned run|ER]], and was on the mound for [[Endy Chavez]]'s famous catch.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaEQVKIDGU |title=2006 NLCS Game 7: Endy Chavez makes a spectacular leaping catch |date=October 19, 2006 |website=YouTube |publisher=MLB |access-date=October 9, 2018 }}</ref> The Mets eventually lost the game 3\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|title=October 19, 2006, National League Championship Series (NLCS) Game 7, Cardinals at Mets|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN200610190.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nEntering the {{baseball year|2007}} season, there were concerns about the Mets' pitching staff and whether P\u00e9rez could live up to his potential. However, P\u00e9rez finished the 2007 season 15\u201310 with a 3.56 ERA, striking out 174 in 177 innings pitched, while walking 79 (7th-most in the NL).<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/2007-pitching-leaders.shtml]</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn the 2008 season, P\u00e9rez was inconsistent, posting a record of 10\u20137 with a 4.22 ERA. He was also prone to big innings striking at any moment. An example was in a start against the [[San Francisco Giants]], he went {{frac|1|3}} of an inning allowing 5 hits and 6 runs, all of them earned. An example of his dominance was his start against the [[New York Yankees]] on June 29. P\u00e9rez went 7 innings allowing just one run on a home run by [[Wilson Betemit]], striking out a season-high 8 batters. After the firing of manager [[Willie Randolph]], P\u00e9rez pitched better. At the request of [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and pitching coach [[Dan Warthen]], he changed his delivery to the plate. Instead of letting his head hang down when he made his delivery, he made a bowing motion.  He led the majors in walks, with 105, and was 10th in the NL in wild pitches, with 9.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-batting-pitching.shtml |title=2008 Major League Baseball Batting Against |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/perezol01.shtml]</ref> His 17 [[no decision]]s were the most among MLB starting pitchers in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/Y5KNu|title=Pitching Game Finder: For 2008, Recorded no decision, as Starter, sorted by greatest number of games in a single season matching the selected criteria|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}</ref> \n\nOn February 3, {{mlby|2009}}, the Mets signed P\u00e9rez to a three-year $36 million deal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090202&content_id=3791758&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym|title=Perez signs three-year deal with Mets|accessdate=February 3, 2009 |author=Marty Noble |publisher=MLB.com |date=February 3, 2009 }}</ref> On May 6, P\u00e9rez was put on the disabled list due to patellar tendinitis in his right leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090506&content_id=4595576&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym|title=Perez headed to DL; Niese coming up|work=New York Mets|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> He returned to the rotation on July 8, 2009.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} On August 26, P\u00e9rez was diagnosed with [[patellar]] [[tendinitis]] in his right knee and underwent season-ending surgery.

He previously played for the [[San Diego Padres]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[New York Mets]], [[Seattle Mariners]], [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Houston Astros]], and [[Washington Nationals]]. He has also competed for the [[Mexican national baseball team]] in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|2006]], [[2009 World Baseball Classic|2009]], and [[2013 World Baseball Classic]]s.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===San Diego Padres===\nP\u00e9rez was signed by the [[San Diego Padres]] as an amateur free agent in 1999. He made his debut with the Padres in {{baseball year|2002}}. P\u00e9rez did well for a [[rookie]] after being called up by the Padres in 2002, striking out over a batter per inning, but he suffered from control issues at times.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} He regressed somewhat in {{baseball year|2003}}.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates===\nIn August 2003, P\u00e9rez was sent by San Diego to Pittsburgh along with [[Jason Bay]] and [[Cory Stewart]] in exchange for [[Brian Giles]].\n\nBefore the {{baseball year|2004}} season, the team overhauled his pitching mechanics. His average of 10.97 [[strikeouts per nine innings]] was highest in the Majors (239 SO/196 IP); his 2.98 ERA was fifth in the [[National League]] (tied with [[Roger Clemens]]); and his 12\u201310 record could have been ever better with reasonable run support early in the season. Pirates' bats provided two or fewer runs in P\u00e9rez' 16 starts before [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] break, causing him to post a 5\u20134 record with five no decisions despite a 3.24 ERA. In that season, P\u00e9rez pitched at least six innings and allowed three or fewer runs in 21 of his 30 starts (70%). Through this first three seasons, P\u00e9rez had compiled a 20\u201325 record with 474 [[strikeout]]s and a 3.86 [[Earned run average|ERA]] in 412.2 [[innings pitched|innings]]. His 239 strikeouts that year are currently the third-most in a season by a modern-day Pirate, trailing only [[Bob Veale]]'s 276 in {{Baseball year|1965}} and 250 in {{Baseball year|1964}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nBy contrast, P\u00e9rez's {{baseball year|2005}} season was disappointing. He posted a 5.85 ERA in a season plagued by injuries. The Pirates were forced to place him on the [[disabled list]] on June 29 after he broke his toe kicking a cart following a loss to St. Louis. He missed two and a half months, returning in September to post a 4.58 ERA in 19.2 late season innings. P\u00e9rez had also lost significant speed off his fastball.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nP\u00e9rez represented Mexico in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|inaugural]] [[World Baseball Classic]], where Mexico was eliminated in the second group stage.<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 World Baseball Classic - Results|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/2006_World_Baseball_Classic#Round_Two|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2006 World Baseball Classic (Rosters)|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/2006_World_Baseball_Classic_(Rosters)#Mexico|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, P\u00e9rez opened the Pirates' season as the number one starter. On June 27, P\u00e9rez was sent to the Pirates bullpen after struggling through the first half of the season with an ERA over 6.00. On June 29, he was sent to the Triple-A [[Indianapolis Indians]], with [[Tom Gorzelanny]] being called up to replace him in the starting rotation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rutter|first1=Joe|title=Perez sent down to Triple-A|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/pirates/s_460142.html|website=Trib Live|publisher=Trib Total Media, Inc.|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===New York Mets===\n[[File:\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez on October 3, 2010.jpg|250px|thumb|P\u00e9rez pitching for the [[2010 New York Mets season|New York Mets in 2010]]]]\nOn July 31, 2006, P\u00e9rez and [[Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez (relief pitcher)|Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez]] were traded to the [[New York Mets]] in exchange for [[Xavier Nady]]. The Mets assigned P\u00e9rez to their AAA affiliate, the [[Norfolk Tides]]. He was recalled to the Mets' major league roster on August 26, 2006. After two subpar starts, P\u00e9rez threw a complete game shutout against the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] on September 6.<ref>{{cite web|title=September 6, 2006, Atlanta Braves at New York Mets Play by Play and Box Score|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN200609062.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Mets lost two starting pitchers to injury in the final week before the playoffs started, they were forced to use P\u00e9rez in the playoff rotation. His first playoff start came in Game 4 of the NLCS, in which he picked up his first career postseason win. His second playoff start came in [[2006 National League Championship Series#Game 7|Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS]] vs. the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]]. He pitched six innings in, allowing one [[Earned run|ER]], and was on the mound for [[Endy Chavez]]'s famous catch.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaEQVKIDGU |title=2006 NLCS Game 7: Endy Chavez makes a spectacular leaping catch |date=October 19, 2006 |website=YouTube |publisher=MLB |access-date=October 9, 2018 }}</ref> The Mets eventually lost the game 3\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|title=October 19, 2006, National League Championship Series (NLCS) Game 7, Cardinals at Mets|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN200610190.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nEntering the {{baseball year|2007}} season, there were concerns about the Mets' pitching staff and whether P\u00e9rez could live up to his potential. However, P\u00e9rez finished the 2007 season 15\u201310 with a 3.56 ERA, striking out 174 in 177 innings pitched, while walking 79 (7th-most in the NL).<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/2007-pitching-leaders.shtml]</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn the 2008 season, P\u00e9rez was inconsistent, posting a record of 10\u20137 with a 4.22 ERA. He was also prone to big innings striking at any moment. An example was in a start against the [[San Francisco Giants]], he went {{frac|1|3}} of an inning allowing 5 hits and 6 runs, all of them earned. An example of his dominance was his start against the [[New York Yankees]] on June 29. P\u00e9rez went 7 innings allowing just one run on a home run by [[Wilson Betemit]], striking out a season-high 8 batters. After the firing of manager [[Willie Randolph]], P\u00e9rez pitched better. At the request of [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and pitching coach [[Dan Warthen]], he changed his delivery to the plate. Instead of letting his head hang down when he made his delivery, he made a bowing motion.  He led the majors in walks, with 105, and was 10th in the NL in wild pitches, with 9.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-batting-pitching.shtml |title=2008 Major League Baseball Batting Against |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/perezol01.shtml]</ref> His 17 [[no decision]]s were the most among MLB starting pitchers in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/Y5KNu|title=Pitching Game Finder: For 2008, Recorded no decision, as Starter, sorted by greatest number of games in a single season matching the selected criteria|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}</ref> \n\nOn February 3, {{mlby|2009}}, the Mets signed P\u00e9rez to a three-year $36 million deal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090202&content_id=3791758&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym|title=Perez signs three-year deal with Mets|accessdate=February 3, 2009 |author=Marty Noble |publisher=MLB.com |date=February 3, 2009 }}</ref> On May 6, P\u00e9rez was put on the disabled list due to patellar tendinitis in his right leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090506&content_id=4595576&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym|title=Perez headed to DL; Niese coming up|work=New York Mets|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> He returned to the rotation on July 8, 2009.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} On August 26, P\u00e9rez was diagnosed with [[patellar]] [[tendinitis]] in his right knee and underwent season-ending surgery.

Melvin then had [[Chad Pinder]] (right) pinch-hit for [[Matt Joyce (baseball)|Matt Joyce]] (left), so Francona countered by replacing P\u00e9rez with right-handed reliever [[Zach McAllister]], thus making P\u00e9rez the first MLB pitcher to officially pitch in a game without actually throwing any pitches.\n\nThe Indians re-signed P\u00e9rez to a one-year contract on January 25, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=Indians re-sign LHP Oliver P\u00e9rez |url=https://www.mlb.com/indians/news/indians-re-sign-lhp-oliver-perez/c-303159156 |publisher=Indians.com |date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> The deal includes a vesting option for the 2020 season.

In some counties the winner of the event became the National Champion even if the winning team came from a different country, like the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] or the [[United States]]. In other countries like [[Germany]], [[Austria]] or [[Italy]] the Champion is the first team from the organizing country even if they do not win the event. Since the Soling has always been an \"open\" class in that spirit we list in this overview the winners of the event. The first boat of the organizing country can be found in the references.\n\nThe [[Soling Australian Championship|Australian Soling Championship]] is recognized as an Continental Championship like the [[Soling European Championship|Europeans]] and the [[Soling North American Championship|North]] and [[Soling South American Championship| South Americans]]. Therefor the Championships of [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]] are listed. However [[Scotland]] is not a member of [[World Sailing]] they Nationals are listed any way since the event is listed under National Championships in the Soling Guide of 1996-2000. <ref name=\"SolingGuide1996\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Winners of National Championships ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

In some counties the winner of the event became the National Champion even if the winning team came from a different country, like the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] or the [[United States]]. In other countries like [[Germany]], [[Austria]] or [[Italy]] the Champion is the first team from the organizing country even if they do not win the event. Since the Soling has always been an \"open\" class in that spirit we list in this overview the winners of the event. The first boat of the organizing country can be found in the references.\n\nThe [[Soling Australian Championship|Australian Soling Championship]] is recognized as an Continental Championship like the [[Soling European Championship|Europeans]] and the [[Soling North American Championship|North]] and [[Soling South American Championship| South Americans]]. Therefor the Championships of [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]] are listed. However [[Scotland]] is not a member of [[World Sailing]] they Nationals are listed any way since the event is listed under National Championships in the Soling Guide of 1996-2000. <ref name=\"SolingGuide1996\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Winners of National Championships ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

The company regards a selected period of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' chart (only from 1952 to 1960) and the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart from 1960 to 1969 as predecessors for the period prior to 11 February 1969, where multiples of competing charts (none official) coexisted side by side. For example, the BBC compiled its own chart based on an average of the music papers of the time; many songs announced as having reached number one on BBC Radio and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' prior to 1969 are not listed as chart-toppers according to the legacy criteria of the Charts Company.\n\nThe first number one on the UK Singles Chart was \"[[Here in My Heart]]\" by [[Al Martino]] for the week ending date 14 November 1952. As of the week ending date 16 April 2020, the UK Singles Chart has had 1367 different number-one hits. The current number-one single is \"[[Blinding Lights]]\" by [[The Weeknd]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== {{anchor|early}}Early charts ===\nBefore the compilation of sales of records, the music market measured a song's popularity by sales of [[sheet music]]. The idea of compiling a chart based on sales originated in the [[United States]], where the music-trade paper ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' compiled the first chart incorporating sales figures on 20 July 1940.

The sales diaries were translated into [[Punched card|punch cards]] so the data could be interpreted by a computer. A computer then compiled the chart on Monday, and the BBC were informed of the Top 50 on Tuesday in time for it to be announced on [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)#BBC Radio 1|Johnnie Walker's afternoon show]]. The charts were also published in ''Record Retailer'' (rebranded ''Record & Tape Retailer'' in 1971 and ''[[Music Week]]'' in 1972)<ref name=\"BL\"/> and ''[[Record Mirror]]''.<ref name=\"McAleer\"/> However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The [[1971 United Kingdom postal workers strike|1971 postal strike]] meant data had to be collected by telephone, but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart; by 1973, the BMRB was using [[motorcycle courier]]s to collect sales figures.<ref name=\"McAleer\"/> In March 1978, two record industry publications, ''Radio & Record News'' and ''Record Business'' both started publishing Top 100 singles charts, so in response, in May 1978, the BMRB singles chart was expanded from a Top 50 to a Top 75, while abolishing the system where some falling records were excluded from the 41-50 section, as well as abandoning the additional list of 10 \"Breakers\".

The chart show was then rebranded for the chart week ending 16 April, and the first singles chart combining physical-release sales with legal downloads began. Several test charts (and a download-sales chart) were published in 2004; this combination (within the official singles chart) reflected a changing era in which sales of physical singles fell and download sales rose. On 17 April 2005, hosts JK and Joel commented during their [[BBC Radio 1]] broadcast that the incorporation of download sales resulted in an approximate doubling of singles sales for the week. For the first week's combined chart the impact of this doubling was not readily apparent at the top of the chart, although a few singles in the middle positions benefited.\n\nInitially, the British Association of Record Dealers was concerned that the popularity of downloading would siphon business from the [[High Street]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} It also complained that including singles not available physically would confuse customers and create gaps in stores' sale racks. However, it agreed to the new rules provided that digital sales were only included to a single's sales tally if there was a physical equivalent sold in shops at the time. Since there was no rule governing a minimum number of pressings, [[Gorillaz]] released only 300 vinyl copies of their single \"[[Feel Good Inc.]]\" on 12 April 2005 (a month before its general release). This allowed it to debut in the chart at number 22 (eventually reaching number 2), and remain in the Top 40 for a longer period.\n\nAfter pressure from elsewhere in the music industry a second compromise was reached in 2006, which now allowed singles to chart on downloads the week before their physical release. The first song to make the Top 40 on downloads alone was \"[[Pump It]]\" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]], which charted at number 16 on 12 March 2006. Three weeks later, \"[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]\" by [[Gnarls Barkley]] became the first song to top the charts on download sales alone. As part of the revised rules, singles would now be removed from the chart two weeks after the deletion of their physical formats; \"Crazy\" left the chart 11 weeks later from number 5. This was in addition to the existing rule that to be eligible for the chart, the physical single had to have been released within the last twelve months, supporting the general view that the chart reflected the top-selling \"current\" releases.\n\nOn 1 January 2007 the integration of downloaded music into the charts became complete when all downloads \u2013 with or without a physical equivalent \u2013 became eligible to chart, redefining the UK singles chart by turning it into a \"songs\" chart. \"[[Chasing Cars]]\" by [[Snow Patrol]] returned at a Top 10 position (number 9, just three places below the peak it had reached the previous September), while \"[[Honey to the Bee]]\" by [[Billie Piper]] (following a tongue-in-cheek promotional push by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[Chris Moyles]] to test the new chart rules) reappeared at number 17 (nearly eight years after its original appearance on the charts).\n\nThe first number-one hit never released physically was \"[[Run (Snow Patrol song)#Leona Lewis version|Run]]\" by [[Leona Lewis]], the 11th song in total to reach number one on downloads alone. Unlike the previous 10, it did not receive a physical release in subsequent weeks (although it was released physically overseas, notably in Germany).\n\nIt was announced in June 2014 that as of Sunday, 29 June, audio streams from services such as [[Spotify]], [[Deezer]], [[Napster]], O2 Tracks, [[Xbox Music]], Sony Unlimited and [[Rara.com|rara]] would be counted towards the Official Singles Chart, in order to reflect changing music consumption in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kreisler|first1=Lauren|title=UK's Official Singles Chart to include streaming data for first time|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uks-official-singles-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time-3105/|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=OfficialCharts.com|date=22 June 2014}}</ref> The final number one on the UK Singles Chart to be based on sales alone was \"[[Gecko (Overdrive)]]\" by [[Oliver Heldens]] featuring [[Becky Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/oliver-heldens-and-becky-hill-knock-ella-henderson-off-number-1-3124/|title=Oliver Heldens and Becky Hill knock Ella Henderson off Number 1|work=officialcharts.com}}</ref> On Sunday 6 July 2014, the [[Official Charts Company]] announced that [[Ariana Grande]] had earned a place in UK chart history when her single \"[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]\" featuring [[Iggy Azalea]] became the first number-one single based on sales and streaming data.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=Daniel|title=Ariana Grande earns a place in Official Chart history with Problem|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/ariana-grande-earns-a-place-in-official-chart-history-with-problem-3146/|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|date=6 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 December 2014, [[Ed Sheeran]]'s \"[[Thinking Out Loud]]\" became the first single to reach number one as a direct result of streaming inclusion.

However, the deal ended when the website went out of business in late 2001. As part of an agreement with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' to publish the UK chart in section of their magazine, ''Billboard'' required the chart to have a sponsor. In 2003, it was announced that [[Coca-Cola]] had signed a two-year contract with the Official Charts Company beginning 1 January 2004. Although the amount was not publicly disclosed, it was believed to be between [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1.5&nbsp;million and \u00a32&nbsp;million. Since advertising on the BBC is prohibited under the [[BBC Charter]] and the government was attempting to reduce [[childhood obesity]], the decision was widely criticised. Coca-Cola was restricted to two on-air mentions during the chart show, with the BBC justifying the deal by saying it did not negotiate or benefit financially.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Legrand|first=Emmanuel|date=13 December 2003|title=Coke Deal is Real Thing for U.K. Music Charts|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]]|volume=115|issue=50|pages=9, 62|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> A few days into the contract, the BBC agreed to drop on-air mentions of the brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=6029&sectioncode=1|title=BBC to pull chart sponsor credits|date=2 January 2004|work=[[Music Week]]|accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[List of artists who reached number one on the UK Singles Chart]]\n*[[List of artists who have spent the most weeks on the UK music charts]]\n*[[List of best-selling singles by year in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[List of UK Singles Chart number ones]]\n*[[Lists of UK top 10 singles]]\n*[[Official Classical Singles Chart]]\n*[[Official Subscription Plays Chart]]\n*[[List of one-hit wonders on the UK Singles Chart]]\n*[[UK R&B Chart]]\n*[[UK Albums Chart]]\n*[[UK Indie Chart]]\n\n;Chart magazines\n*''[[UKChartsPlus]]''\n*''[[Music Week]]''\n*''[[Record Retailer]]''\n*''[[Hit Music]]''\n\n;Rival charts\n*[[The Network Chart Show]]\n*[[Pepsi Chart (UK)|Pepsi Chart]]\n*[[Hit40uk]]\n*[[The Big Top 40 Show]]\n*[[The eXpat Chart]]\n\n;Chart books\n*''[[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums]]''\n*''[[Complete UK Hit Singles 1952\u20132006]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n;Footnotes\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Sources\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|last3=Osborne|first3=Roger|first=Dafydd|last=Rees|first2=Barry|last2=Lazell|title=Forty Years of \"NME\" Charts|edition=2nd|year=1995|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Pan Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0-7522-0829-9|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last1=Warwick|first1=Neil|last2=Kutner|first2=Jon|last3=Brown|first3=Tony|title=The Complete Book Of The British Charts: Singles and Albums|edition=3rd|year=2004|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-84449-058-5|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records: British Hit Singles and Albums (18th edition)|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2005|isbn=978-1-904994-00-8|publisher=[[HiT Entertainment|Guinness World Records Limited]]|ref=harv|title-link=Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Martin|date=May 1991|title=Reading the Charts &ndash; Making Sense with the Hit Parade|journal=Popular Music|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=10|issue=2|pages=205&ndash;217|issn=0261-1430|ref=harv|doi=10.1017/s0261143000004517|jstor=853061}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n*[http://www.officialcharts.com/media/647278/official-uk-charts-singles-chart-rules-march-2015.pdf Rules for Chart Eligibility: Singles]\n*{{bbc.co.uk|radio1/chart/singles}}\n*[http://www.musicweek.com/ Music Week] Top 75 {{small|(subscription only)}}\n{{UK Music Charts}}\n{{Music industry}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Uk Singles Chart}}\n[[Category:BBC Radio 1]]\n[[Category:British record charts]]\n[[Category:1969 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British singles sales chart}}\n{{About|the UK singles chart|the BBC Radio 1 show|The Official Chart}}\n{{redirect|UK Top 40|the TV programme which ran from 2002 to 2005|UK Top 40 (TV series)}}\n[[File:UK Singles Chart logo.png|frame|right|Official Chart logo]]\n{{Use British English|date=January 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe '''UK Singles Chart''' (currently entitled '''Official Singles Chart''') is compiled by the [[Official Charts Company]] (OCC), on behalf of the British [[record industry]], listing the top-selling singles in the [[United Kingdom]], based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and [[music streaming|streaming]].

The company regards a selected period of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' chart (only from 1952 to 1960) and the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart from 1960 to 1969 as predecessors for the period prior to 11 February 1969, where multiples of competing charts (none official) coexisted side by side. For example, the BBC compiled its own chart based on an average of the music papers of the time; many songs announced as having reached number one on BBC Radio and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' prior to 1969 are not listed as chart-toppers according to the legacy criteria of the Charts Company.\n\nThe first number one on the UK Singles Chart was \"[[Here in My Heart]]\" by [[Al Martino]] for the week ending date 14 November 1952. As of the week ending date 9 April 2020, the UK Singles Chart has had 1367 different number-one hits. The current number-one single is \"[[Blinding Lights]]\" by [[The Weeknd]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== {{anchor|early}}Early charts ===\nBefore the compilation of sales of records, the music market measured a song's popularity by sales of [[sheet music]].

The sales diaries were translated into [[Punched card|punch cards]] so the data could be interpreted by a computer. A computer then compiled the chart on Monday, and the BBC were informed of the Top 50 on Tuesday in time for it to be announced on [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)#BBC Radio 1|Johnnie Walker's afternoon show]].

The [[1971 United Kingdom postal workers strike|1971 postal strike]] meant data had to be collected by telephone, but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart; by 1973, the BMRB was using [[motorcycle courier]]s to collect sales figures.<ref name=\"McAleer\"/> In March 1978, two record industry publications, ''Radio & Record News'' and ''Record Business'' both started publishing Top 100 singles charts, so in response, in May 1978, the BMRB singles chart was expanded from a Top 50 to a Top 75, while abolishing the system where some falling records were excluded from the 41-50 section, as well as abandoning the additional list of 10 \"Breakers\". Earlier that year, the [[Daily Mirror]] and the BBC's [[Nationwide]] television programme both investigated chart hyping, where record company representatives allegedly purchased records from chart return shops. A ''[[World in Action]]'' documentary expos\u00e9 in 1980 also revealed corruption within the industry; stores' chart-returns dealers would frequently be offered bribes to falsify sales logs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT77&lpg=PT77&dq=World+in+Action+John+Fruin&source=bl&ots=_9ijhk4sy2&sig=n4RQeR9vlzuBw-uu3sMMhlAvoYs&hl=en&ei=rHOFTPSzEcWOjAf2sZQQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=World%20in%20Action%20John%20Fruin&f=false|title=Inquiry Expected After Claims Of U.K. Chart Hyping|last=Hennesey|first=Mike|date=30 August 1980|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=1, 78, 83|accessdate=6 September 2010|location=London}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Electronic age}}Electronic-age charts ===\nFrom 1983 to 1990, the chart was financed by BPI (50 percent), ''[[Music Week]]'' (38 percent) and the BBC (12 percent).{{sfn|Parker|1991|p=206}} On 4 January 1983 the chart compilation was assumed by [[the Gallup Organization]], which expanded the chart with a \"Next 25\" in addition to the Top 75{{refn|The expansion was not a Top 100, ''per se'', as records were excluded from positions 76&ndash;100 if their sales had fallen in two consecutive weeks and if their sales had fallen by 20 per cent compared to the previous week.<ref name=\"Zywietz\">{{Cite book|last=Zywietz|first=Tobias|title=British Chart Books Classified|url=http://www.zobbel.de/bdc/BDC1.pdf|accessdate=10 September 2010|date=27 April 2005|location=Neulingen, Germany}}<!-- Tobias Zywietz compiler for ''Chartwatch'': http://www.chartwatch.co.uk/BACKNUM.htm --></ref>|group=\"nb\"}} and began the introduction of computerised compilers, automating the data-collection process.<ref name=\"McAleer\"/><ref name=\"The Official Charts Company\"/> In July 1987, Gallup signed a new agreement with BPI, increasing the sample size to approximately 500 stores and introducing [[barcode scanners]] to read data.<ref name=\"MWCountdown\">{{cite journal|date=8 May 1993|first=Ajax|last=Scott|title=Countdown to a new era|journal=[[Music Week]]|issn=0265-1548}}</ref> The chart was based entirely on sales of vinyl single records from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday (due to the new, automated process).{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=14}}\n\nThe 1980s also saw the introduction of the [[cassette single]] (or \"cassingle\") alongside the [[7-inch single|7-inch]] and [[12-inch single|12-inch]] record formats; in 1987, major record labels developed a common format for the compact disc single.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/02/arts/cassette-singles-new-45-s.html|title=Cassette Singles: New 45's|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=2 September 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=21|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> In May 1989, chart regulations kept [[Kylie Minogue]]'s song \"[[Hand on Your Heart]]\" from entering at number one because sales from cassette singles were not included (they were sold for \u00a31.99 \u2013 cheaper than allowed at the time).

The chart show was then rebranded for the chart week ending 16 April, and the first singles chart combining physical-release sales with legal downloads began. Several test charts (and a download-sales chart) were published in 2004; this combination (within the official singles chart) reflected a changing era in which sales of physical singles fell and download sales rose. On 17 April 2005, hosts JK and Joel commented during their [[BBC Radio 1]] broadcast that the incorporation of download sales resulted in an approximate doubling of singles sales for the week. For the first week's combined chart the impact of this doubling was not readily apparent at the top of the chart, although a few singles in the middle positions benefited.\n\nInitially, the British Association of Record Dealers was concerned that the popularity of downloading would siphon business from the [[High Street]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} It also complained that including singles not available physically would confuse customers and create gaps in stores' sale racks. However, it agreed to the new rules provided that digital sales were only included to a single's sales tally if there was a physical equivalent sold in shops at the time. Since there was no rule governing a minimum number of pressings, [[Gorillaz]] released only 300 vinyl copies of their single \"[[Feel Good Inc.]]\" on 12 April 2005 (a month before its general release). This allowed it to debut in the chart at number 22 (eventually reaching number 2), and remain in the Top 40 for a longer period.\n\nAfter pressure from elsewhere in the music industry a second compromise was reached in 2006, which now allowed singles to chart on downloads the week before their physical release. The first song to make the Top 40 on downloads alone was \"[[Pump It]]\" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]], which charted at number 16 on 12 March 2006. Three weeks later, \"[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]\" by [[Gnarls Barkley]] became the first song to top the charts on download sales alone. As part of the revised rules, singles would now be removed from the chart two weeks after the deletion of their physical formats; \"Crazy\" left the chart 11 weeks later from number 5. This was in addition to the existing rule that to be eligible for the chart, the physical single had to have been released within the last twelve months, supporting the general view that the chart reflected the top-selling \"current\" releases.\n\nOn 1 January 2007 the integration of downloaded music into the charts became complete when all downloads \u2013 with or without a physical equivalent \u2013 became eligible to chart, redefining the UK singles chart by turning it into a \"songs\" chart. \"[[Chasing Cars]]\" by [[Snow Patrol]] returned at a Top 10 position (number 9, just three places below the peak it had reached the previous September), while \"[[Honey to the Bee]]\" by [[Billie Piper]] (following a tongue-in-cheek promotional push by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[Chris Moyles]] to test the new chart rules) reappeared at number 17 (nearly eight years after its original appearance on the charts).\n\nThe first number-one hit never released physically was \"[[Run (Snow Patrol song)#Leona Lewis version|Run]]\" by [[Leona Lewis]], the 11th song in total to reach number one on downloads alone. Unlike the previous 10, it did not receive a physical release in subsequent weeks (although it was released physically overseas, notably in Germany).\n\nIt was announced in June 2014 that as of Sunday, 29 June, audio streams from services such as [[Spotify]], [[Deezer]], [[Napster]], O2 Tracks, [[Xbox Music]], Sony Unlimited and [[Rara.com|rara]] would be counted towards the Official Singles Chart, in order to reflect changing music consumption in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kreisler|first1=Lauren|title=UK's Official Singles Chart to include streaming data for first time|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uks-official-singles-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time-3105/|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=OfficialCharts.com|date=22 June 2014}}</ref> The final number one on the UK Singles Chart to be based on sales alone was \"[[Gecko (Overdrive)]]\" by [[Oliver Heldens]] featuring [[Becky Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/oliver-heldens-and-becky-hill-knock-ella-henderson-off-number-1-3124/|title=Oliver Heldens and Becky Hill knock Ella Henderson off Number 1|work=officialcharts.com}}</ref> On Sunday 6 July 2014, the [[Official Charts Company]] announced that [[Ariana Grande]] had earned a place in UK chart history when her single \"[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]\" featuring [[Iggy Azalea]] became the first number-one single based on sales and streaming data.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=Daniel|title=Ariana Grande earns a place in Official Chart history with Problem|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/ariana-grande-earns-a-place-in-official-chart-history-with-problem-3146/|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|date=6 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 December 2014, [[Ed Sheeran]]'s \"[[Thinking Out Loud]]\" became the first single to reach number one as a direct result of streaming inclusion.
