These themselves are said to be Europe's biggest [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church ruin.\n\nIn 1967, the town hosted the seventh ''[[Hessentag]]'' state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nThe town lies in the Hersfeld Basin formed here by the forks of the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and the Haune. The inner town lies on the Fulda's left bank. Furthermore, the Geisbach and the Solz empty into the Fulda in the municipal area. In the southwest lie the [[Vogelsberg Mountains]], in the northwest the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and in the northeast the [[Seulingswald]] (ranges, the latter visible in the background of this image).\n\nThe town's lowest point, at 195&nbsp;m above [[sea level]], is to be found in the area where the Solz empties into the Fulda, whereas the highest point within town limits is the Laxberg in the Kn\u00fcllgebirge, at 408&nbsp;m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\nThe town can be said to belong both to Northern Hesse (''Nordhessen'') and Eastern Hesse (''Osthessen'').\n\nThe nearest cities are [[Kassel]], 52&nbsp;km to the north, [[Gie\u00dfen]], 79&nbsp;km to the southwest, [[Fulda]], 36&nbsp;km to the south and [[Eisenach]], 45&nbsp;km to the east. Through Bad Hersfeld runs the ''Deutsche Fachwerkstra\u00dfe'' (\u201cGerman [[Timber framing|Timber Frame]] Road\u201d), a holiday road that showcases many of Germany's timber-frame houses and buildings.\n\n=== Geology ===\nThe Old Town stands on an [[Alluvium|alluvial]] or [[fluvial]] [[Alluvial fan|fan]] made of gravel and pebbles, which were washed up between Fulda and Geisbach. Also in the Fulda valley are found gravel and pebbles from the [[Holocene]] that are mostly of alluvial origin. There are layers of flood-deposited [[loess]] and [[loam]] of [[Pleistocene]] origin running through them. The gravel and pebbles are to a great extent made up of Middle [[Bunter (geology)|Bunter]], the most widespread stone here. In the west and east, this layer reaches from the Germanic [[Triassic]] on the Stellerskuppe (480.5&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]) and the Haukuppe (446.1&nbsp;m above sea level) up to 400&nbsp;m above sea level. In the east, on the Wippershainer H\u00f6he (heights), the layer reaches up to 440&nbsp;m above sea level. The Middle Bunter's lower limit is found at about 110&nbsp;m above sea level.\n\nNewer mineral layers from the Triassic are found only in sporadic deposits and discontinuous layers within town limits. This is the R\u00f6t formation, which crops up in the headwaters of the many small brooks around the town. The Lower or Middle [[Muschelkalk]] that overlies it can only be found in a narrow, west-to-east running [[rift]] stretching between Heenes and Oberrode, north of the inner town. The newest mineral layer from the Triassic \u2013 the Lower Keuper (for example the so-called ''Lettenkohlensandstein'') \u2013 is only preserved in the region under a lava flow, which does not show itself above ground anywhere near the town.\n\nOwing to uplift in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]], there are no mineral layers from these geological time periods. Volcanic rock from the [[Miocene]] can be found on the Haukuppe.\n\nMineral layers that do not reach the surface here are the Lower Bunter, running from a depth of some 90&nbsp;m underneath the town (about 110&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]) down to some 390&nbsp;m farther down, and, following at yet greater depths, Upper and Lower [[Zechstein]] from the [[Permian]]. From this layer come the two mineral springs in Bad Hersfeld. This layer is also used in underground mining from the 400-metre level on down on the [[Werra]] (Heringen, Philippsthal) and on the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] (Neuhof bei Fulda), yielding [[potash]].<ref>Klaus Walter: ''Der geologische Aufbau des Kreises Hersfeld'' in Mein Heimatland, November 1961 Band 19. (supplement to the ''Hersfelder Zeitung'')</ref>\n\n=== Municipal area\u2019s extent ===\nToday's main town spreads over the slopes of the Tageberg (323.5&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]), the Frauenberg (310&nbsp;m), the Wehneberg (320&nbsp;m) and the Wendeberg (291&nbsp;m), further reaching into the valleys of the Meisebach and the Geisbach. From southwest to northeast it stretches some 4.5&nbsp;km, and from northeast to southwest some 3.5&nbsp;km.\n\nThe Old Town in the Fulda valley has an oval shape and an area of some 40&nbsp;ha. From west to east it stretches some 960&nbsp;m and from south to north some 570&nbsp;m. This can still clearly be seen today, as where the town moat once led around the town there is today a ringroad that leads traffic around it.\n{{wide image|Hersfeld1 panorama.jpg|1500px|View from the Johannesberg over Bad Hersfeld}}\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nBesides the main town \u2013 also called Bad Hersfeld \u2013 the town also has the outlying centres of Allmershausen, Asbach, Beiershausen, Eichhof, Heenes, Hohe Luft, Johannesberg, Kathus, Kohlhausen, Petersberg and Sorga.\n\nFurther subdivisions in the main town are not officially ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]''. The Old Town itself is divided into the ''Stiftsbezirk'' (\u201cMonastery Zone\u201d) and the ''Unterstadt'' (\u201cLower Town\u201d) to the east. Between the two lies the oldest part of the Old Town. The spa is centred in a spot west of the ''Stiftsbezirk'' and is considered part of the main town. Furthermore, there are Kalkobes (a village that was amalgamated by the turn of the 20th century), Wehneberg (which arose from a lordly estate), Zellersgrund, Oberrode (an agricultural operation), Hof H\u00e4hlgans (likewise an agricultural operation) and M\u00f6nches (now forsaken; a former forester's house stands here).\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nClockwise from the north, these are [[Ludwigsau]], [[Friedewald, Hesse|Friedewald]], [[Schenklengsfeld]], [[Hauneck]], [[Niederaula]], [[Kirchheim, Hesse|Kirchheim]] and [[Neuenstein, Hesse|Neuenstein]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe town's sheltered location in the Fulda valley with the surrounding Hessian and [[Thuringia]]n low mountain ranges leads to a relatively high average yearly temperature in Bad Hersfeld of 8.7&nbsp;\u00b0C and a rather dry climate with yearly precipitation averaging only 718.1&nbsp;mm. The average yearly sunshine, therefore, is quite high at 1,385.4 hours. On average over the year, Bad Hersfeld has 34 \u201csummer days\u201d (that is, with temperatures reaching 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or higher), 86 \u201cfrost days\u201d (with the day's lowest temperature below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C) and 22 \u201cice days\u201d (with the day's temperature never rising above 0&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kupferstich hersfeld 1655.jpg|thumb|Copperplate [[engraving]] of Hersfeld in 1655 (Matth\u00e4us Merian the Younger)]]\nBad Hersfeld's written history begins with the monk [[Saint Sturm|Sturm]], who established a monastic settlement in ''Haerulfisfeld'' but later evacuated it to [[Fulda]], and with [[Lullus]], who re\u00ebstablished the [[Benedictine]] [[Hersfeld Abbey]] in 769. Both had been missionary bishop [[Saint Boniface|Boniface's]] disciples. The monastery was enlarged between 831 and 850 and Lullus's remains were moved in 852 to another grave in the new basilica. During this ceremony his [[canonisation]] was announced by [[Rabanus Maurus]]. Since 852, the ''Lullusfest'', the oldest folk festival in Germany, has been celebrated in the week of Saint Lullus's day, 16 October (his day of death). [[Martin Luther]] visited the monastery, on his way back from the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521 and held a sermon in the abbey church on 1 May. About two years later, the town and the territory of the abbey was mostly [[Protestantism|Protestant]].\n\nIt has been shown, however, through [[Archaeology|archaeological]] digs that today's townsite has a considerably longer settlement history, with traces of habitation going back to the [[New Stone Age]] about 2000 BC; a [[Bronze Age]] grave from about 1200 BC has also been unearthed, as have finds from [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne times]] about 400 BC.\n[[File:Hersfeld stadtkirche turm.jpg|thumb|left|The town's landmark, the tower of the ''Hersfelder Stadtkirche'' (Town church)]]\nHersfeld was first mentioned as a market centre in 1142 and as a town in 1170. At this time also came the Hersfeld Abbey's greatest importance in Imperial politics. In the centuries that followed, the Abbey's might ebbed as after the Great [[Interregnum]] (1254\u20131273) it could no longer enjoy the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]\u2019s support. Beginning in 1373, the [[Landgraviate of Hesse]] acquired influence over the town through defensive alliances. On ''Vitalisnacht'' (Saint Vitalis\u2019s night, 27\u201328 April) 1378, the power struggle between the Abbey and the town reached its high point. Because of the [[German Peasants' War]] in 1525, great parts of the town and the Abbey passed to Hesse. In 1606, the last abbot died and in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, the Imperial Abbey, raised to Electorate, was awarded to the Landgraviate of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]]. Hersfeld, now a worldly electorate, henceforth belonged to Hesse-Kassel.\n\nIn 1439, great parts of the town were destroyed by fire. The oldest [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house in town is the ''K\u00fcsterhaus'' (Sexton\u2019s House\u201d) from 1452. Abbot Ludwig V (1571\u20131588) brought the town its last building boom for centuries in which he had the Abbey's buildings expanded and converted in the \u201cWeser Renaissance\u201d style. These can still be seen throughout the Old Town, for instance the former mint and the ''Schloss Eichhof'' (palatial castle).\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]] the French army used the former abbey church as a supply and food depot. In 1761, the French burnt the church and the monastery buildings down to destroy their supplies during their retreat, thus destroying one of the largest churches in Germany, and in 1807, the town was almost utterly destroyed by [[Napoleon]]ic occupation troops, but was spared when it turned out that [[Baden]] Lieutenant Colonel Johann Baptist Lingg von Linggenfeld would only carry out Napoleon's orders \u201cliterally\u201d: he was supposed to set fire to the town on all four sides, and this he did by having four buildings, each standing away from others, set on fire.\n[[File:Hersfeld kaserne haupt.jpg|thumb|Main building of the former barracks in Bad Hersfeld (Hohe Luft). Between 1948 and 1993 it was the McPheeters Barracks of the United States Army.]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] King [[George III]] of [[England]] hired the [[Musketeer Regiment Prinz Carl]] along with other regiments from [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse]]. The Musketeer Regiment Prinz Carl was stationed both before and after their return from America at Hersfeld.\n\nIn 1821, Hersfeld became the seat of Hersfeld district in the [[Electorate of Hesse]]. In the same century, Hersfeld was linked to the [[railway]] network in 1866, and the town has also had an [[Autobahn]] link since 1938 (today [[Bundesautobahn 7]] northwards via [[Kassel]] and  [[Hamburg]] to [[Scandinavia]] and southwards via [[Kirchheim, Hesse|Kirchheim]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]] to [[Austria]]. The [[Bundesautobahn 4]] coming from Kirchheim links eastwards via [[Dresden]] and [[G\u00f6rlitz]] to [[Poland]]. The development into a spa town began when the Lullusbrunnen ([[spring (hydrology)|spring]]) was tapped in 1904.\n\nIn 1935 the barracks was built in the outskirts of Hersfeld (today Hohe Luft), by the [[Wehrmacht]]. In 1945, Hersfeld was once again spared utter destruction, when two officers who had been taken prisoner guaranteed the town's peaceful handover.\n\nThe United States Army took over the Wehrmacht's barracks. Between 1948 and 1993 it was the McPheeters Barracks.  Here served the 3rd Squadron, 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment (1948 until 1972) and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (1972 until 1993) at the [[Inner German border]]. About 800 American soldiers manned the barracks and its three observation posts, designated OP Romeo, OP India and OP Oscar. They also conducted two patrols daily along the border trace. The Americans had no interest in civilians crossing the border. Theirs was a tactical mission to halt possible Warsaw Pact aggression. Bad Hersfeld lies in the Fulda Gap, a historical avenue used for armies of the past. Bad Hersfeld was the northern most American border garrison and the first line of defense during the days of the [[Cold War]]. While small in numbers, the US forces were heavily equipped with a nuclear capability. They were primarily equipped with armored personnel carriers, artillery, and main battle tanks. They were augmented with combat engineers and an anti-aircraft missile site. However, they patrolled the Russian-American Demarcation Line in pairs of jeeps to avoid damage to the roads.\n[[File:Hersfeld kaserne gedenkstein.jpg|thumb|100px|Memorial stone in the former McPheeters Barracks. It was erected in honor of the soldiers who did their military service in Bad Hersfeld.]]\n\nBeginning in 1949, the town was called '''Bad''' Hersfeld, and as of 1963 it became a Hessian State Spa, which was municipalized in 2006. (''Bad'' is [[German language|German]] for \u201cbath\u201d, and is a title given towns by [[States of Germany|state]] governments in recognition of their spa status).\n\nIn May 1983, 5,000 people in the town demonstrated against a reunion of soldiers from the [[Waffen-SS]]. Among the protest organizers were also the organizers of the ''Bad Hersfelder Festspiele''.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe area of the town of Bad Hersfeld today belongs to the ''Evangelische Kirche von Kurhessen-Waldeck'' (\u201c[[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] Church of the Electorate of Hesse-Waldeck\u201d), and the largely co\u00ebxtensive [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Bishopric of Fulda.\n\nBesides the two big churches, various communities and [[free church]]es can be found in Bad Hersfeld, among them the State Church Community, the Evangelical Free Church Community ([[Baptists]]), the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh Day Adventists]] and the Free Christian Community ([[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]).\n\nFurther religious communities in Bad Hersfeld are the [[New Apostolic Church]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\n=== Amalgamations ===\nIn 1918, Kalkobes was amalgamated and in 1928 so was the area that later became the outlying centre od Johannesberg (''Dom\u00e4ne Johannesberg und Bingartes''). In 1972, the centres named above under \u201cConstituent communities\u201d were amalgamated. Moreover, the districts of Hersfeld and Rotenburg were merged into one new district, [[Hersfeld-Rotenburg]], and Bad Hersfeld became its seat.\n\n=== Population development ===\nIn 1525, 400 men lived in the town, and presumably this meant only householders \u2013 men with townsman's rights. Before the [[Thirty Years' War]], in 1614, there were 725 households, putting the town's population at this time somewhere between 3,300 and 3,600. The town only reached this figure once again in the mid-18th century. The leftmost chart below shows the sharp drop in the town's population due to the Thirty Years' War.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years' War, the population figure rose only slowly, falling back in the wake of many wars, disease outbreaks and famines. Only beginning in the mid-19th century, as the town was spreading outside to old town walls and as the textile and machine building industries were growing did the population figure rise sharply. Between 1910 and 1913, it surpassed 10,000 and after the [[Second World War]], sometime between 1946 and 1950, it reached the 20,000 mark. After eleven villages were amalgamated in 1972, the population reached some 27,000, and sometime between 1987 and 1994, the town's population reached 30,000.\n\nGiven the population structure and the forecast migration to [[urban agglomeration]]s, the HA Hessen Agentur GmbH foresees that the district's population will shrink by 6% by 2020.<ref>Article in the ''Hersfelder Zeitung'' from 9 February 2007 \u201eHintergrund: Als w\u00e4re Philippstahl weg\u201c, see also http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/landesdaten/bevoelkerung-2050/bevoelkerung-insgesamt-in-hessen-2006-2020-2050/index.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This fall is therefore also foreseen within the same timeframe for the town.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Haushalte entwicklung mittelalter hersfeld.jpg|Number of free householders in Bad Hersfeld in the Middle Ages\nFile:Einwohnerentwicklung since1645 hersfeld.jpg|Population development since the Thirty Years' War\nFile:Einwohnerentwicklung 100j hersfeld.jpg|Population development over the last hundred years\n</gallery>\n\n== Politics ==\n[[File:Rathaus hersfeld.jpg|thumb|Bad Hersfeld's Town Hall]]\n\n=== Town council ===\nThe municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" | '''Parties and voter communities'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''%<br/>2006'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''Seats<br/>2006'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''%<br/>2001'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''Seats<br/>2001'''\n|----\n|CDU\n|[[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]]\n|align=\"right\" |33.9\n|align=\"right\" |15\n|align=\"right\" |35.7\n|align=\"right\" |16\n|----\n|SPD\n|[[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]\n|align=\"right\" |47.7\n|align=\"right\" |22\n|align=\"right\" |48.1\n|align=\"right\" |22\n|----\n|GREENS\n|[[B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen]]\n|align=\"right\" |3.0\n|align=\"right\" |1\n|align=\"right\" |6.0\n|align=\"right\" |3\n|----\n|FDP\n|[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]]\n|align=\"right\" |4.7\n|align=\"right\" |2\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|----\n|FWG\n|Freie W\u00e4hlergemeinschaft Bad Hersfeld\n|align=\"right\" |3.4\n|align=\"right\" |2\n|align=\"right\" |7.1\n|align=\"right\" |3\n|----\n|BfH\n|B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr Hersfeld\n|align=\"right\" |2.5\n|align=\"right\" |1\n|align=\"right\" |3.1\n|align=\"right\" |1\n|----\n|independent\n|Unabh\u00e4ngige Wahlalternative Bad Hersfeld\n|align=\"right\" |3.8\n|align=\"right\" |2\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|----\n|DIE LINKE.\n|[[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]\n|align=\"right\" |1.0\n|align=\"right\" |0\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" |'''Total'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''100.0'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''45'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''100.0'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''45'''\n|--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" |'''Voter turnout in %'''\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |'''43.7'''\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |'''43.9'''\n|}\nThe SPD and the FWG form one faction in the current election period.\n\nThe executive (''Magistrat'') is made up of 7 councillors and the mayor.

He quit on August 31, 2010. He was followed by Mr. Seitz.

The \u201cdouble cross\u201d stems from the [[Benedictine]] abbey of Hersfeld. The Lion of Hesse appeared in the town's arms after the conquest in the Peasants\u2019 War from [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]] in 1525.\n\n====Older coats of arms====\nThe oldest known town seal, from 1256, shows the patron saint [[Wigbert]]. The smaller seal from the 14th century shows the patron [[Simon the Zealot]] and [[Jude the Apostle]] of the Benedictine abbey of Hersfeld with the [[Wheel of Mainz]] and the double cross. In the Late Gothic town seal, this cross was the only [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]. At Philip I's conquest, it was displaced by the Lion of Hesse.\n\nA stylized double cross also appears in the Bad Hersfeld town logo designed in 2008. It is supposed to be used for marketing and the Internet.\n\n===Twin towns - sister cities===\nBad Hersfeld is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften der Kreisstadt Bad Hersfeld|url=https://www.bad-hersfeld.de/engagement/partnerschaftsverein.html|website=bad-hersfeld.de|publisher=Bad Hersfeld|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Bad Salzungen]], Germany, since 1990\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses]], France, since 1994\n*{{flagicon|CZE}} [[\u0160umperk]], Czech Republic, since 1979\n\n===Sponsorships===\n*Already by 1954, the town had undertaken a sponsorship for [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Sudeten Germans]] driven out of \u0160umperk \u2013 formerly M\u00e4hrisch-Sch\u00f6nberg \u2013 in Moravia.\n*A sponsorship with the [[German Navy]] [[Fast Attack Craft]] \u201cS 75 Zobel\u201d has existed since 1969.\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\nThe town has since 1962 yearly awarded the ''[[Hersfeld-Preis]]'' to actors of the current festival season. Another honour awarded by the town is the ''Ulenroder Kruzifix'', a cast taken of a [[bronze]] crucifix from the early 11th century that was found in the abandoned village of Ulenrode, which lay above Meckbach in what is now the community of Ludwigsau.\n\n=== Theatre ===\nEvery summer, the ''[[Bad Hersfelder Festspiele]]'' (festival) are<!--Grammar is correct; \u201cFestspiele\u201d is PLURAL.-->  held. Outside the festival season, theatrical productions are given in the ''Stadthalle'', an event venue.\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Bad Hersfeld Town Museum is housed in the only wing of the former monastery complex that is still preserved, south of the monastery ruins themselves. Besides the departments for town and monastery history, the department for town handicrafts is also worthy of mention.\n\nIn [[Konrad Duden]]\u2019s memory is a small museum right next door to the former Old Monastery School (on the New Market). Here Duden was active from 1876 to 1905 as principal, which is why the school now bears his name.\n\nThe ''Haus M\u00e4hrisch Sch\u00f6nberg'' shows a local history collection from the formerly German district of Landkreis M\u00e4hrisch-Sch\u00f6nberg in what was the [[Sudetenland]] (on the New Market).\n\nSince 2006 there has been a small savings bank museum at the main branch of the ''[[Sparkasse]] Bad Hersfeld-Rotenburg'' in which is displayed the history of the financial institution and the changes in the banking world in a great number of exhibits.\n\n=== Buildings ===\n[[File:Stiftsruine Hersfeld.jpg|thumb|Monastery ruins in Bad Hersfeld]]\nIn the Old Town are 216 buildings under monumental protection.<ref>according to an article in the ''Hersfelder Zeitung'' by Johannes van Horrick (monument caretaker for the town of Bad Hersfeld) on 15 January 2007</ref> On the west side of the Old Town are found the monastery ruins. They are Europe\u2019s biggest ecclesiastical ruin, and are now used as a venue for the ''Bad Hersfelder Festspiele''. In the monastery zone stands the Katharinenturm (tower), in which hangs the ''[[Lullusglocke]]'', Germany\u2019s oldest dated [[Church bell|bell]] (cast in 1038 AD). Furthermore, a wing of the [[cloister]] has been preserved (today a museum; chapter house preserved) and likewise great parts of the remnants of the town wall (South Gate, ''Halbschalenturm'' or \u201cHalf-Shell Tower\u201d). The two ''Nordschulteiche'' (ponds) in the Leonhard M\u00fcller Complex are leftovers of the town moat. In this park is also found Saint Vitalis's Cross (the original can be seen in the museum). It stands on the spot where the townsmen fought off the attack by the ''Sternerbund'' in 1378. Further remnants of the town fortifications stand in the Lower Town (east side of the Old Town), among them the ''Klausturm'' (a watchtower and prison) and the somewhat smaller ''Pulverturm'' (\u201cPowder Tower\u201d)\n\nFurthermore, on Johannestor (a street) is found the ''Elisabeth-Hospital'', endowed in 1239, with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] chapel. Other Abbey buildings are the Schloss Eichhof and the ruins \u2013 the ''Bruderhaus'' \u2013 of the former Johannesberg provost's house. Both buildings lie some 3&nbsp;km from the Old Town and can also be reached on foot from the spa park.\n[[File:Hersfeld pfarrhaus.jpg|thumb|100px|Oldest [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house in Bad Hersfeld from 1452]]\n\nIn the centre of Bad Hersfeld's Old Town stands the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ''Stadtkirche'' (\u201cTown Church\u201d) whose 14th-century tower is the town's landmark. On the church square stands a continuous row of [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] buildings, among them the former ''K\u00fcsterhaus'' (sexton's house), which is the town's oldest timber-frame house, built in 1452. Right next to this stands the Town Hall, which was built about 1371 in the Gothic style and remodelled and expanded between 1607 and 1612 in the [[Weser Renaissance]] style. Further timber-frame houses are to be found throughout the [[pedestrian precinct]]. Particularly worthy of mention here is the richly decorated ''Zimmermannshaus'' (\u201cCarpenter\u2019s House\u201d) on Klausstra\u00dfe.\n\nOn Linggplatz, the Abbey's old court square (old stone \u201cdouble cross\u201d), a statue recalls [[Baden]] Lieutenant Colonel Johann Baptist Lingg von Linggenfeld, who saved the town from being burnt down by Napoleonic troops in 1807. Beside this lies the marketplace on which patrician houses from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] times stand, among them the old mint. They were remodelled in the [[Renaissance]] and bear witness, with their gables like the timber-frame houses across the street, to the monastery's last building boom. On the ''Neumarkt'' (\u201cNew Market\u201d) stands, besides the other timber-frame houses, the ''Linggklause'' (Lieutenant Colonel Lingg's dwelling). Here, too, are the old monastery school (nowadays the ''Konrad-Duden-Schule'') and the Konrad Duden Museum.\n\n=== Parks ===\nThe biggest park in town is the ''Kurpark'', or spa park (some 6.5&nbsp;ha) with the ''Kurhaus'' (spa house), the pump room and the spring pavilion. Right near the Old Town is found the ''Leonardt-M\u00fcller-Anlage'' (park), along the town wall, with the two ''Nordschulteiche'' (ponds). In the monastery zone is another park, which in 2006 was expanded with a perennial plant garden. Both the spa park and the ''Leonardt-M\u00fcller-Anlage'' were remodelled between 2006 and 2007.\n\nFurther greenspaces are the 15-hectare Fuldapark with its Fuldasee (lake) and the ''Carl-Strau\u00df-Anlage'' on the Kleinsh\u00f6he (heights) on the Tageberg.\n\n=== Sport ===\n*Besides the football clubs in many centres, there is the SVA Bad Hersfeld club, which with its first team is playing in the Fu\u00dfball-Verbandsliga Hessen Nord in the 2008/2009 season. The second team plays in the Bezirksliga Fulda Nord, and the A-Juniors belong, for the third year now, to the Hyundai Oberliga Hessen. Further ball sports are played at the Turnverein Hersfeld 1848 e. V. (gymnastic club). Among others, there are [[team handball]], [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]].\n*The team of the SG Hessen Hersfeld played from the 1997/1998 season until the 2002/2003 season in the women's Handball-Bundesliga.\n*The three rowing and canoe clubs, Hersfelder Kanu-Club 1924 e. V., Kanu-Wanderer Hersfeld 1986 e. V. and Hersfelder Ruderverein 1977 e. V. carry out their activity in the summer, mainly on the Fulda. The last-named club also engages in competitive rowing.\n*Besides the shooting clubs in almost every outlying centre, there is also the Hersfelder Sch\u00fctzengilde (\u201cMarksmen\u2019s Guild\u201d) 1252 e. V. It is one of Germany's oldest still-active clubs.\n*The Luftsportverein Bad Hersfeld e. V. ([[air sports]]) has its [[Glider aircraft|glider]] facility on the Langenberg near Hattenbach (a constituent community of [[Niederaula]]).\n\n=== Regular events ===\n[[File:Festspiele eroeffnung1 hersfeld.jpg|thumb|Opening of the ''Bad Hersfelder Festspiele'']]\n[[File:Hersfelder lullusfest lingplatz.jpg|thumb|left|''Lullusfest'']]\nNationally known are the yearly ''Bad Hersfelder Festspiele'', opera festival and the festival concerts. They are held between June and August in the monastery ruins. Other great musical events for every taste is the Bad Hersfeld [[Bach family|Bach]] Days event (every year at [[Easter]] at the Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus), the Live-[[Jazz]]-Festival (every year on the first weekend in June on stages throughout the Old Town), the ''StadtJugendNacht'' (\u201cTown Youth Night\u201d; yearly on the first Saturday in September under the ''Peterstorbr\u00fccke'' [bridge]) and the ''Metalfest'' (late every year).\n\nThe ''Lullusfest'' is known for being Germany's oldest folk festival. It is held every year in the week in which 16 October falls. Other greater folk festivals are the shooting festival of the marksmen's guild in the J\u00e4gersgraben and the Tagebergfest of the volunteer fire brigade (an outdoor forest festival).\n\nAmong sporting events that can be named are the ''Sauer Lollslauf'', a marathon run on the occasion of the ''Lullusfest'', and the ''Internationale Bad Hersfelder [[Deutscher Motorsport Verband|DMV]]-Grasbahnrennen'' held each summer by the Motorsportclub Bad Hersfeld e. V. on a 500&nbsp;m-long track.\n\nMost markets in town are held on Linggplatz. The weekly market is held twice a week and a flea market takes place from April to October on the first Saturday of each month. Other, yearly, markets are the Easter Market on Wednesday before Good Friday, the Whitsun Market on Wednesday before Whitsunday, the ''Gro\u00dfe Lulluskrammarkt'' (\u201cGreat Lullus Traders\u2019 Market\u201d) on Wednesday during ''Lullusfest'' and the Autumn Market on Penance Day, the Wednesday before 23 November (this day is known in Germany as ''[[Bu\u00df- und Bettag]]'', an [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] observance).\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nSince [[German reunification]] Bad Hersfeld has lain in the middle of Germany, favourably located on the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 7|A&nbsp;7]], leading the region to develop into a stronghold for logistics firms.\n\nThe town appears in Hesse's state development plan as a middle centre partly functioning as a higher centre. The town maintains a large volunteer fire brigade, which sometimes sees service elsewhere in Germany.\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n==== Highway ====\nThe north-south [[Autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&nbsp;5]] (Hattenbach\u2013[[Basel]]) and [[Bundesautobahn 7|A&nbsp;7]] ([[Flensburg]]\u2013[[F\u00fcssen]]) meet the east-west Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] ([[Aachen]]\u2013[[G\u00f6rlitz]]) at the Kirchheim and Hattenbach three-leg [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s.\n\nMoreover, the north-south ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 27 (from the [[Harz]] to [[Lake Constance]]) and the east-west ''Bundesstra\u00dfe'' 62 (from [[Marburg]] to [[Bad Salzungen]]) play an important role. ''Bundesstra\u00dfe'' 324 serves as an Autobahn feeder to the A&nbsp;7. All three ''Bundesstra\u00dfen'' meet each other in Bad Hersfeld.\n\n==== Railway ====\n[[File:KnuellwaldbahnHEF.JPG|thumb|A railway crossing at the ''Kurpark'' on the ''Kn\u00fcllwaldbahn'', nowadays only used for goods services]]\nBad Hersfeld lies on the [[Kassel]]\u2013[[Bebra]]\u2013[[Fulda]] [[railway]] line. There is an [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] connection every two hours from [[Frankfurt am Main]] by way of [[Fulda]] to [[Eisenach]]\u2013[[Erfurt]]\u2013[[Weimar]]\u2013[[Leipzig]]\u2013[[Berlin]]/[[Dresden]]. Regional trains run to, among other places, [[Kassel]] and [[G\u00f6ttingen]]. Just behind Hersfeld [[railway station]], the ''Kn\u00fcllwaldbahn'' branches off.\n\n==== Local public transport ====\nThe local public transport is run by the ''Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund'' (\u201cNorth Hesse Transport Association\u201d, NVV). The nine town and four intercity bus routes are run by \u00dcberlandwerk Fulda AG (\u00dcWAG Bus GmbH).\n\nThe ''Hersfelder Kreisbahn'' run by the ''Hersfelder Eisenbahngesellschaft'', a local railway line running from Bad Hersfeld to [[Philippsthal (Werra)|Philippsthal]] \u2013 roughly 11&nbsp;km \u2013 was abandoned in 1993, and the stretch as far as [[Schenklengsfeld]] has been converted into a cycling path.\n\n==== Air transport ====\nThe ''Flugplatz Johannesberg'' has the status of Special Airfield. The runway, some 671&nbsp;m long and 18&nbsp;m wide, is paved with asphalt and oriented in a north-south direction. The airfield lies on the Johannesberg in the like-named outlying centre at an elevation of 284&nbsp;m above [[sea level]].\n\nThe airfield was built by the [[United States Army]] between 1952 and 1953 and belonged to McPheeter Barracks in the outlying centre of Hohe Luft. It was known at that time as US Army Airfield Werve-Thompson. When the US Army pulled out in 1993, the airfield was taken over by Motor-Flieger-Club e.&nbsp;V. Bad Hersfeld.\n\n=== Established businesses ===\nAmong businesses in the oldest field of endeavour in Bad Hersfeld, textile manufacturing, is the firm Performance Fibers (formerly the [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] works, which makes high-strength [[polyester]] fibres. Further long-established family businesses are the mineral oil dealer and operator of the LOMO filling stations Lorenz Mohr GmbH & Co. KG and the building firm Kirchner Holding GmbH. Working in the field of electronics are EMS ([[Electronics manufacturing services|Electronic Manufacturing Services]]) service provider EN ElectronicNetwork Hersfeld GmbH (formerly Zuse KG, later [[Siemens]] AG, and KRONE Kommunikationstechnik GmbH) and Thales e-Transactions GmbH. In the field of machine building and process engineering, the firms Grenzebach BSH GmbH (in Schilde AG's old buildings), [[The Linde Group|Linde Ladenbau GmbH & Co. KG]] and TLT Turbo GmbH (since 2006 owned by Siemens AG) can be named. The logistics field settled here for the most part only after [[German reunification]]. After [[Amazon.com|amazon.de]] and Libri, a book wholesaling firm, came the logistics firm [[RS Components]], setting up its European hub in Bad Hersfeld.\n\nA further important economic factor is the hospital establishment, which in part also supports the spa operations. The following hospitals and clinics are to be found in town: the ''Klinikum Bad Hersfeld'' and the ''Krankenhaus St. Elisabeth Bad Hersfeld'', which are active mainly in general medicine, and the spa clinics ''Klinik im Kurpark'' (clinic for psychosomatic medicine and orthopaedics), ''Fachklinik Wigbertsh\u00f6he'' (clinic for sociopsychosomatic illnesses), ''Klinik am Hainberg'' (clinic for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy), ''Vitalisklinik'' (clinic for digestive and metabolic disorders) and the ''Orthop\u00e4dische Akutklinik''.\n\nThe biggest bank in town is the ''[[Sparkasse]] Bad Hersfeld-Rotenburg''.\n\n=== Music ===\nEach year after the ''Festspiele'', an opera festival is held in the monastery ruins. Even during the time of the ''Festspiele'', though, the ''Arbeitskreis f\u00fcr Musik e. V. '' (\u201cmusic workshop\u201d) has staged the ''Bad Hersfelder Festspielkonzerte'' in the monastery ruins, in the ''Stadthalle'' and at ''Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus'' since 1961. Furthermore, seasonal concerts are held the year round in the ''Stadthalle'' and at ''Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus''. Among them are<!--Grammar is correct; \u201cBachtage\u201d is PLURAL.-->  the ''Internationale Bachtage in Hessen und Th\u00fcringen'' at which each year during Holy Week and at Easter great choral works and chamber music extravaganzas are produced.\n\nAlso, each year on the first weekend in June is the jazz festival. National and international stars as well as groups from the town itself liven up the town the whole weekend long from morning until late evening with [[Swing music|swing]], [[Beat music|beat]] and [[blues]]. For many years this festival has been a great yearly highlight, drawing many visitors from all over.\n\nIn autumn, the yearly ''Cross Music Metalfest'' is held, at which many hard rock and metal bands from all over the world appear. It is always held on the first weekend in October and draws visitors from all over Europe.\n\n=== Media ===\nThe local daily newspaper is the ''Hersfelder Zeitung'' (founded in 1763) and the twice weekly advertising flier ''Kreisanzeiger'' has been distributed free since 1980. Both papers have belonged to the publishing business Dirk Ippen. Competition comes from an independent advertising flier published since August 2008, the ''Express Waldhessen''. Since several months the \"Express Waldhessen\" has a new name. It's called \"Klartext\". In addition sind 2004 there is another small Newspaper made by Bodo Neumann. It's called: \"EXTRABLATT\" which will be free distributed every 14 days.\n\nSince 1 May 2008, FunRadio Hersfeld<ref>FunRadio Hersfeld [http://www.FunRadio-Hersfeld.de Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006202542/http://funradio-hersfeld.de/ |date=2008-10-06 }}</ref> has been broadcasting from the town.\n\n=== Public institutions ===\nBesides the customary institutions usually found in a district seat, and those already described under \u201cCulture and sightseeing\u201d, there are the ''Stadthalle'' (literally \u201ctown hall\u201d, but actually an event venue, not connected at all with the town's administration; \u201ctown hall\u201d is ''Rathaus'' in [[German language|German]]), the book caf\u00e9 (sponsor: Verein f\u00fcr Kultur und Kommunikation e. V.) and the ''Konrad-Duden-Stadtbibliothek'' (town library). This was opened in March 1999 on the marketplace in Bad Hersfeld. The public library has a total floor area of some 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2. On 31 December 2007, it had an inventory of some 65,000 media, and yearly media borrowings amount to 210,000.\n\nIn the field of sport, there are two baths, the Aqua Fit (sport and family bath) and the Kurbad Therme ([[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] bath) at the spa park. Moreover, there is the heated [[swimming pool]] Geistalbad. Many other sports can be pursued at the Jahn-Park (sport and leisure centre), the [[Nordic walking|Nordic-Walking]]-Park and the sport and tennis grounds in Bad Hersfeld.\n\n==== Spa operations ====\n[[File:Kurpark bad hersfeld.jpg|thumb|Bad Hersfeld's ''Kurpark'' (\u201cspa park\u201d)]]\nIn Bad Hersfeld are two mineral springs. The ''Lullusquelle'' was newly bored in 1904. It was documented as early as 1518, but was overwhelmed in a flood in the 17th century. The ''Vitalisbrunnen'' was bored in 1949. The water is heavy with [[Sodium sulfate|Glauber's salt]]. Bottled mineral water has also been available since 2006 under the name ''Naturquellen Bad Hersfeld''.\n\nThe spa operations therefore primarily entail drinking and bathing treatments, which are used to deal with liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestinal and metabolic illnesses, as well as psychosomatic illnesses, musculoskeletal illnesses and [[Rheumatism|rheumatic disorders]]. After spa privatization failed in 2005, the town once again took charge of the administration.\n\n==== Youth ====\nBesides the various football and sport clubs, youths also have a chance to meet each other after school in one of Bad Hersfeld's supervised institutions for fostering the town's youth. One possible choice is the ''Jugendhaus Bad Hersfeld'' on Dippelstra\u00dfe, which is popular among youth mainly for its many events.\n\n=== Education ===\nIn Bad Hersfeld are three [[comprehensive school]]s, ''Gesamtschule Geistal'', ''Gesamtschule Obersberg'' and ''Konrad-Duden-Schule'', the last-named of which was founded in 1570 by Abbot Michael of the [[Hersfeld Abbey]] as a monastery school. From 1876 to 1905, [[Konrad Duden]] was the principal at the then ''K\u00f6nigliches Gymnasium zu Hersfeld'', which was named in his honour in 1980.\n\nThe pilot school ''Modellschule Obersberg'' offers a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]-type upper level.\n\nFurthermore, there are six [[primary school]]s, ''[[Ernst von Harnack|Ernst-von-Harnack]]-Schule'', ''Grundschule An der Sommerseite'', ''Grundschule Sorga'', ''Kolibri-Grundschule'', ''Linggschule'' und ''Wilhelm-Neuhaus-Schule''. There is also a special school, [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich-Fr\u00f6bel]]-Schule.\n\nAlso, there are three vocational schools, ''Berufliche Schulen des Landkreises Hersfeld-Rotenburg'' (''Europaschule''), ''Berufsbildungszentrum Metall'' and ''Bildungszentrum f\u00fcr Handel und Dienstleistung''.\n\nFurther training and higher education is to be had at the ''Studienakademie f\u00fcr Logistik'' (department of the ''Berufsakademie Nordhessen''), the evening school for adults, the Academy of the DGUV (''Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung'', or \u201cGerman Legal Accident Insurance\u201d), the ''Deutsche Angestellten Akademie'', the ''Evangelische Jugendbildungsst\u00e4tte Frauenberg'' (\u201c[[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] Youth Education Centre\u201d, sponsored by the Evangelical Church of Electoral Hesse-Waldeck), the district [[folk high school]] and the Hersfeld-Rotenburg district music school.\n\n== Famous people ==\n\n=== Honorary citizens ===\n* Leonhard M\u00fcller (born 1799; died 1878),\n:: the [[Electorate of Hesse]] land and road building master\n:: Honoured in 1834\n:: He undertook the first measures to preserve the Bad Hersfeld monastery ruins, designed the ''Luisenschule'' and many other buildings in town.\n\n* Dr. Wilhelm M\u00fcnscher (born 1795; died 1872),\n:: Gymnasium principal in Hersfeld from 1832 to 1867\n:: Honoured in 1857\n\n* Wilhelm Neuhaus (born 25 December 1873; died 16 December 1956),\n:: Teacher and vice-principal at the Evangelical elementary school (former ''Nordschule'', today ''Fr\u00f6belschule'') and later at the ''S\u00fcdschule'' (it has borne his name since 1962), ''Heimatforscher'' (\u201chomeland researcher\u201d)\n:: Honoured in 1948\n\n==Notable people==\nThis list, arranged by birthdate, contains people who were born in Bad Hersfeld as well as some who worked, but were not born, here.

These themselves are said to be Europe's biggest [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church ruin.\n\nIn 1967, the town hosted the seventh ''[[Hessentag]]'' state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nThe town lies in the Hersfeld Basin formed here by the forks of the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and the Haune. The inner town lies on the Fulda's left bank. Furthermore, the Geisbach and the Solz empty into the Fulda in the municipal area. In the southwest lie the [[Vogelsberg Mountains]], in the northwest the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and in the northeast the [[Seulingswald]] (ranges, the latter visible in the background of this image).\n\nThe town's lowest point, at 195&nbsp;m above [[sea level]], is to be found in the area where the Solz empties into the Fulda, whereas the highest point within town limits is the Laxberg in the Kn\u00fcllgebirge, at 408&nbsp;m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\nThe town can be said to belong both to Northern Hesse (''Nordhessen'') and Eastern Hesse (''Osthessen'').\n\nThe nearest cities are [[Kassel]], 52&nbsp;km to the north, [[Gie\u00dfen]], 79&nbsp;km to the southwest, [[Fulda]], 36&nbsp;km to the south and [[Eisenach]], 45&nbsp;km to the east. Through Bad Hersfeld runs the ''Deutsche Fachwerkstra\u00dfe'' (\u201cGerman [[Timber framing|Timber Frame]] Road\u201d), a holiday road that showcases many of Germany's timber-frame houses and buildings.\n\n=== Geology ===\nThe Old Town stands on an [[Alluvium|alluvial]] or [[fluvial]] [[Alluvial fan|fan]] made of gravel and pebbles, which were washed up between Fulda and Geisbach. Also in the Fulda valley are found gravel and pebbles from the [[Holocene]] that are mostly of alluvial origin. There are layers of flood-deposited [[loess]] and [[loam]] of [[Pleistocene]] origin running through them. The gravel and pebbles are to a great extent made up of Middle [[Bunter (geology)|Bunter]], the most widespread stone here. In the west and east, this layer reaches from the Germanic [[Triassic]] on the Stellerskuppe (480.5&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]) and the Haukuppe (446.1&nbsp;m above sea level) up to 400&nbsp;m above sea level. In the east, on the Wippershainer H\u00f6he (heights), the layer reaches up to 440&nbsp;m above sea level. The Middle Bunter's lower limit is found at about 110&nbsp;m above sea level.\n\nNewer mineral layers from the Triassic are found only in sporadic deposits and discontinuous layers within town limits. This is the R\u00f6t formation, which crops up in the headwaters of the many small brooks around the town. The Lower or Middle [[Muschelkalk]] that overlies it can only be found in a narrow, west-to-east running [[rift]] stretching between Heenes and Oberrode, north of the inner town. The newest mineral layer from the Triassic \u2013 the Lower Keuper (for example the so-called ''Lettenkohlensandstein'') \u2013 is only preserved in the region under a lava flow, which does not show itself above ground anywhere near the town.\n\nOwing to uplift in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]], there are no mineral layers from these geological time periods. Volcanic rock from the [[Miocene]] can be found on the Haukuppe.\n\nMineral layers that do not reach the surface here are the Lower Bunter, running from a depth of some 90&nbsp;m underneath the town (about 110&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]) down to some 390&nbsp;m farther down, and, following at yet greater depths, Upper and Lower [[Zechstein]] from the [[Permian]]. From this layer come the two mineral springs in Bad Hersfeld. This layer is also used in underground mining from the 400-metre level on down on the [[Werra]] (Heringen, Philippsthal) and on the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] (Neuhof bei Fulda), yielding [[potash]].<ref>Klaus Walter: ''Der geologische Aufbau des Kreises Hersfeld'' in Mein Heimatland, November 1961 Band 19. (supplement to the ''Hersfelder Zeitung'')</ref>\n\n=== Municipal area\u2019s extent ===\nToday's main town spreads over the slopes of the Tageberg (323.5&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]), the Frauenberg (310&nbsp;m), the Wehneberg (320&nbsp;m) and the Wendeberg (291&nbsp;m), further reaching into the valleys of the Meisebach and the Geisbach. From southwest to northeast it stretches some 4.5&nbsp;km, and from northeast to southwest some 3.5&nbsp;km.\n\nThe Old Town in the Fulda valley has an oval shape and an area of some 40&nbsp;ha. From west to east it stretches some 960&nbsp;m and from south to north some 570&nbsp;m. This can still clearly be seen today, as where the town moat once led around the town there is today a ringroad that leads traffic around it.\n{{wide image|Hersfeld1 panorama.jpg|1500px|View from the Johannesberg over Bad Hersfeld}}\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nBesides the main town \u2013 also called Bad Hersfeld \u2013 the town also has the outlying centres of Allmershausen, Asbach, Beiershausen, Eichhof, Heenes, Hohe Luft, Johannesberg, Kathus, Kohlhausen, Petersberg and Sorga.\n\nFurther subdivisions in the main town are not officially ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]''. The Old Town itself is divided into the ''Stiftsbezirk'' (\u201cMonastery Zone\u201d) and the ''Unterstadt'' (\u201cLower Town\u201d) to the east. Between the two lies the oldest part of the Old Town. The spa is centred in a spot west of the ''Stiftsbezirk'' and is considered part of the main town. Furthermore, there are Kalkobes (a village that was amalgamated by the turn of the 20th century), Wehneberg (which arose from a lordly estate), Zellersgrund, Oberrode (an agricultural operation), Hof H\u00e4hlgans (likewise an agricultural operation) and M\u00f6nches (now forsaken; a former forester's house stands here).\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nClockwise from the north, these are [[Ludwigsau]], [[Friedewald, Hesse|Friedewald]], [[Schenklengsfeld]], [[Hauneck]], [[Niederaula]], [[Kirchheim, Hesse|Kirchheim]] and [[Neuenstein, Hesse|Neuenstein]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe town's sheltered location in the Fulda valley with the surrounding Hessian and [[Thuringia]]n low mountain ranges leads to a relatively high average yearly temperature in Bad Hersfeld of 8.7&nbsp;\u00b0C and a rather dry climate with yearly precipitation averaging only 718.1&nbsp;mm. The average yearly sunshine, therefore, is quite high at 1,385.4 hours. On average over the year, Bad Hersfeld has 34 \u201csummer days\u201d (that is, with temperatures reaching 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or higher), 86 \u201cfrost days\u201d (with the day's lowest temperature below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C) and 22 \u201cice days\u201d (with the day's temperature never rising above 0&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kupferstich hersfeld 1655.jpg|thumb|Copperplate [[engraving]] of Hersfeld in 1655 (Matth\u00e4us Merian the Younger)]]\nBad Hersfeld's written history begins with the monk [[Saint Sturm|Sturm]], who established a monastic settlement in ''Haerulfisfeld'' but later evacuated it to [[Fulda]], and with [[Lullus]], who re\u00ebstablished the [[Benedictine]] [[Hersfeld Abbey]] in 769. Both had been missionary bishop [[Saint Boniface|Boniface's]] disciples. The monastery was enlarged between 831 and 850 and Lullus's remains were moved in 852 to another grave in the new basilica. During this ceremony his [[canonisation]] was announced by [[Rabanus Maurus]]. Since 852, the ''Lullusfest'', the oldest folk festival in Germany, has been celebrated in the week of Saint Lullus's day, 16 October (his day of death). [[Martin Luther]] visited the monastery, on his way back from the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521 and held a sermon in the abbey church on 1 May. About two years later, the town and the territory of the abbey was mostly [[Protestantism|Protestant]].\n\nIt has been shown, however, through [[Archaeology|archaeological]] digs that today's townsite has a considerably longer settlement history, with traces of habitation going back to the [[New Stone Age]] about 2000 BC; a [[Bronze Age]] grave from about 1200 BC has also been unearthed, as have finds from [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne times]] about 400 BC.\n[[File:Hersfeld stadtkirche turm.jpg|thumb|left|The town's landmark, the tower of the ''Hersfelder Stadtkirche'' (Town church)]]\nHersfeld was first mentioned as a market centre in 1142 and as a town in 1170. At this time also came the Hersfeld Abbey's greatest importance in Imperial politics. In the centuries that followed, the Abbey's might ebbed as after the Great [[Interregnum]] (1254\u20131273) it could no longer enjoy the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]\u2019s support. Beginning in 1373, the [[Landgraviate of Hesse]] acquired influence over the town through defensive alliances. On ''Vitalisnacht'' (Saint Vitalis\u2019s night, 27\u201328 April) 1378, the power struggle between the Abbey and the town reached its high point. Because of the [[German Peasants' War]] in 1525, great parts of the town and the Abbey passed to Hesse. In 1606, the last abbot died and in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, the Imperial Abbey, raised to Electorate, was awarded to the Landgraviate of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]]. Hersfeld, now a worldly electorate, henceforth belonged to Hesse-Kassel.\n\nIn 1439, great parts of the town were destroyed by fire. The oldest [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house in town is the ''K\u00fcsterhaus'' (Sexton\u2019s House\u201d) from 1452. Abbot Ludwig V (1571\u20131588) brought the town its last building boom for centuries in which he had the Abbey's buildings expanded and converted in the \u201cWeser Renaissance\u201d style. These can still be seen throughout the Old Town, for instance the former mint and the ''Schloss Eichhof'' (palatial castle).\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]] the French army used the former abbey church as a supply and food depot. In 1761, the French burnt the church and the monastery buildings down to destroy their supplies during their retreat, thus destroying one of the largest churches in Germany, and in 1807, the town was almost utterly destroyed by [[Napoleon]]ic occupation troops, but was spared when it turned out that [[Baden]] Lieutenant Colonel Johann Baptist Lingg von Linggenfeld would only carry out Napoleon's orders \u201cliterally\u201d: he was supposed to set fire to the town on all four sides, and this he did by having four buildings, each standing away from others, set on fire.\n[[File:Hersfeld kaserne haupt.jpg|thumb|Main building of the former barracks in Bad Hersfeld (Hohe Luft). Between 1948 and 1993 it was the McPheeters Barracks of the United States Army.]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] King [[George III]] of [[England]] hired the [[Musketeer Regiment Prinz Carl]] along with other regiments from [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse]]. The Musketeer Regiment Prinz Carl was stationed both before and after their return from America at Hersfeld.\n\nIn 1821, Hersfeld became the seat of Hersfeld district in the [[Electorate of Hesse]]. In the same century, Hersfeld was linked to the [[railway]] network in 1866, and the town has also had an [[Autobahn]] link since 1938 (today [[Bundesautobahn 7]] northwards via [[Kassel]] and  [[Hamburg]] to [[Scandinavia]] and southwards via [[Kirchheim, Hesse|Kirchheim]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]] to [[Austria]]. The [[Bundesautobahn 4]] coming from Kirchheim links eastwards via [[Dresden]] and [[G\u00f6rlitz]] to [[Poland]]. The development into a spa town began when the Lullusbrunnen ([[spring (hydrology)|spring]]) was tapped in 1904.\n\nIn 1935 the barracks was built in the outskirts of Hersfeld (today Hohe Luft), by the [[Wehrmacht]]. In 1945, Hersfeld was once again spared utter destruction, when two officers who had been taken prisoner guaranteed the town's peaceful handover.\n\nThe United States Army took over the Wehrmacht's barracks. Between 1948 and 1993 it was the McPheeters Barracks.  Here served the 3rd Squadron, 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment (1948 until 1972) and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (1972 until 1993) at the [[Inner German border]]. About 800 American soldiers manned the barracks and its three observation posts, designated OP Romeo, OP India and OP Oscar. They also conducted two patrols daily along the border trace. The Americans had no interest in civilians crossing the border. Theirs was a tactical mission to halt possible Warsaw Pact aggression. Bad Hersfeld lies in the Fulda Gap, a historical avenue used for armies of the past. Bad Hersfeld was the northern most American border garrison and the first line of defense during the days of the [[Cold War]]. While small in numbers, the US forces were heavily equipped with a nuclear capability. They were primarily equipped with armored personnel carriers, artillery, and main battle tanks. They were augmented with combat engineers and an anti-aircraft missile site. However, they patrolled the Russian-American Demarcation Line in pairs of jeeps to avoid damage to the roads.\n[[File:Hersfeld kaserne gedenkstein.jpg|thumb|100px|Memorial stone in the former McPheeters Barracks. It was erected in honor of the soldiers who did their military service in Bad Hersfeld.]]\n\nBeginning in 1949, the town was called '''Bad''' Hersfeld, and as of 1963 it became a Hessian State Spa, which was municipalized in 2006. (''Bad'' is [[German language|German]] for \u201cbath\u201d, and is a title given towns by [[States of Germany|state]] governments in recognition of their spa status).\n\nIn May 1983, 5,000 people in the town demonstrated against a reunion of soldiers from the [[Waffen-SS]]. Among the protest organizers were also the organizers of the ''Bad Hersfelder Festspiele''.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe area of the town of Bad Hersfeld today belongs to the ''Evangelische Kirche von Kurhessen-Waldeck'' (\u201c[[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] Church of the Electorate of Hesse-Waldeck\u201d), and the largely co\u00ebxtensive [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Bishopric of Fulda.\n\nBesides the two big churches, various communities and [[free church]]es can be found in Bad Hersfeld, among them the State Church Community, the Evangelical Free Church Community ([[Baptists]]), the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh Day Adventists]] and the Free Christian Community ([[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]).\n\nFurther religious communities in Bad Hersfeld are the [[New Apostolic Church]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\n=== Amalgamations ===\nIn 1918, Kalkobes was amalgamated and in 1928 so was the area that later became the outlying centre od Johannesberg (''Dom\u00e4ne Johannesberg und Bingartes''). In 1972, the centres named above under \u201cConstituent communities\u201d were amalgamated. Moreover, the districts of Hersfeld and Rotenburg were merged into one new district, [[Hersfeld-Rotenburg]], and Bad Hersfeld became its seat.\n\n=== Population development ===\nIn 1525, 400 men lived in the town, and presumably this meant only householders \u2013 men with townsman's rights. Before the [[Thirty Years' War]], in 1614, there were 725 households, putting the town's population at this time somewhere between 3,300 and 3,600. The town only reached this figure once again in the mid-18th century. The leftmost chart below shows the sharp drop in the town's population due to the Thirty Years' War.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years' War, the population figure rose only slowly, falling back in the wake of many wars, disease outbreaks and famines. Only beginning in the mid-19th century, as the town was spreading outside to old town walls and as the textile and machine building industries were growing did the population figure rise sharply. Between 1910 and 1913, it surpassed 10,000 and after the [[Second World War]], sometime between 1946 and 1950, it reached the 20,000 mark. After eleven villages were amalgamated in 1972, the population reached some 27,000, and sometime between 1987 and 1994, the town's population reached 30,000.\n\nGiven the population structure and the forecast migration to [[urban agglomeration]]s, the HA Hessen Agentur GmbH foresees that the district's population will shrink by 6% by 2020.<ref>Article in the ''Hersfelder Zeitung'' from 9 February 2007 \u201eHintergrund: Als w\u00e4re Philippstahl weg\u201c, see also http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/landesdaten/bevoelkerung-2050/bevoelkerung-insgesamt-in-hessen-2006-2020-2050/index.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This fall is therefore also foreseen within the same timeframe for the town.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Haushalte entwicklung mittelalter hersfeld.jpg|Number of free householders in Bad Hersfeld in the Middle Ages\nFile:Einwohnerentwicklung since1645 hersfeld.jpg|Population development since the Thirty Years' War\nFile:Einwohnerentwicklung 100j hersfeld.jpg|Population development over the last hundred years\n</gallery>\n\n== Politics ==\n[[File:Rathaus hersfeld.jpg|thumb|Bad Hersfeld's Town Hall]]\n\n=== Town council ===\nThe municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" | '''Parties and voter communities'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''%<br/>2006'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''Seats<br/>2006'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''%<br/>2001'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''Seats<br/>2001'''\n|----\n|CDU\n|[[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]]\n|align=\"right\" |33.9\n|align=\"right\" |15\n|align=\"right\" |35.7\n|align=\"right\" |16\n|----\n|SPD\n|[[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]\n|align=\"right\" |47.7\n|align=\"right\" |22\n|align=\"right\" |48.1\n|align=\"right\" |22\n|----\n|GREENS\n|[[B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen]]\n|align=\"right\" |3.0\n|align=\"right\" |1\n|align=\"right\" |6.0\n|align=\"right\" |3\n|----\n|FDP\n|[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]]\n|align=\"right\" |4.7\n|align=\"right\" |2\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|----\n|FWG\n|Freie W\u00e4hlergemeinschaft Bad Hersfeld\n|align=\"right\" |3.4\n|align=\"right\" |2\n|align=\"right\" |7.1\n|align=\"right\" |3\n|----\n|BfH\n|B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr Hersfeld\n|align=\"right\" |2.5\n|align=\"right\" |1\n|align=\"right\" |3.1\n|align=\"right\" |1\n|----\n|independent\n|Unabh\u00e4ngige Wahlalternative Bad Hersfeld\n|align=\"right\" |3.8\n|align=\"right\" |2\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|----\n|DIE LINKE.\n|[[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]\n|align=\"right\" |1.0\n|align=\"right\" |0\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|align=\"right\" |\u2013\n|--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" |'''Total'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''100.0'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''45'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''100.0'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''45'''\n|--- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" |'''Voter turnout in %'''\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |'''43.7'''\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |'''43.9'''\n|}\nThe SPD and the FWG form one faction in the current election period.\n\nThe executive (''Magistrat'') is made up of 7 councillors and the mayor.

He quit on August 31, 2010. He was followed by Mr. Seitz.

The \u201cdouble cross\u201d stems from the [[Benedictine]] abbey of Hersfeld. The Lion of Hesse appeared in the town's arms after the conquest in the Peasants\u2019 War from [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]] in 1525.\n\n====Older coats of arms====\nThe oldest known town seal, from 1256, shows the patron saint [[Wigbert]]. The smaller seal from the 14th century shows the patron [[Simon the Zealot]] and [[Jude the Apostle]] of the Benedictine abbey of Hersfeld with the [[Wheel of Mainz]] and the double cross. In the Late Gothic town seal, this cross was the only [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]. At Philip I's conquest, it was displaced by the Lion of Hesse.\n\nA stylized double cross also appears in the Bad Hersfeld town logo designed in 2008. It is supposed to be used for marketing and the Internet.\n\n===Twin towns - sister cities===\nBad Hersfeld is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften der Kreisstadt Bad Hersfeld|url=https://www.bad-hersfeld.de/engagement/partnerschaftsverein.html|website=bad-hersfeld.de|publisher=Bad Hersfeld|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Bad Salzungen]], Germany, since 1990\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses]], France, since 1994\n*{{flagicon|CZE}} [[\u0160umperk]], Czech Republic, since 1979\n\n===Sponsorships===\n*Already by 1954, the town had undertaken a sponsorship for [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Sudeten Germans]] driven out of \u0160umperk \u2013 formerly M\u00e4hrisch-Sch\u00f6nberg \u2013 in Moravia.\n*A sponsorship with the [[German Navy]] [[Fast Attack Craft]] \u201cS 75 Zobel\u201d has existed since 1969.\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\nThe town has since 1962 yearly awarded the ''[[Hersfeld-Preis]]'' to actors of the current festival season. Another honour awarded by the town is the ''Ulenroder Kruzifix'', a cast taken of a [[bronze]] crucifix from the early 11th century that was found in the abandoned village of Ulenrode, which lay above Meckbach in what is now the community of Ludwigsau.\n\n=== Theatre ===\nEvery summer, the ''[[Bad Hersfelder Festspiele]]'' (festival) are<!--Grammar is correct; \u201cFestspiele\u201d is PLURAL.-->  held. Outside the festival season, theatrical productions are given in the ''Stadthalle'', an event venue.\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Bad Hersfeld Town Museum is housed in the only wing of the former monastery complex that is still preserved, south of the monastery ruins themselves. Besides the departments for town and monastery history, the department for town handicrafts is also worthy of mention.\n\nIn [[Konrad Duden]]\u2019s memory is a small museum right next door to the former Old Monastery School (on the New Market). Here Duden was active from 1876 to 1905 as principal, which is why the school now bears his name.\n\nThe ''Haus M\u00e4hrisch Sch\u00f6nberg'' shows a local history collection from the formerly German district of Landkreis M\u00e4hrisch-Sch\u00f6nberg in what was the [[Sudetenland]] (on the New Market).\n\nSince 2006 there has been a small savings bank museum at the main branch of the ''[[Sparkasse]] Bad Hersfeld-Rotenburg'' in which is displayed the history of the financial institution and the changes in the banking world in a great number of exhibits.\n\n=== Buildings ===\n[[File:Stiftsruine Hersfeld.jpg|thumb|Monastery ruins in Bad Hersfeld]]\nIn the Old Town are 216 buildings under monumental protection.<ref>according to an article in the ''Hersfelder Zeitung'' by Johannes van Horrick (monument caretaker for the town of Bad Hersfeld) on 15 January 2007</ref> On the west side of the Old Town are found the monastery ruins. They are Europe\u2019s biggest ecclesiastical ruin, and are now used as a venue for the ''Bad Hersfelder Festspiele''. In the monastery zone stands the Katharinenturm (tower), in which hangs the ''[[Lullusglocke]]'', Germany\u2019s oldest dated [[Church bell|bell]] (cast in 1038 AD). Furthermore, a wing of the [[cloister]] has been preserved (today a museum; chapter house preserved) and likewise great parts of the remnants of the town wall (South Gate, ''Halbschalenturm'' or \u201cHalf-Shell Tower\u201d). The two ''Nordschulteiche'' (ponds) in the Leonhard M\u00fcller Complex are leftovers of the town moat. In this park is also found Saint Vitalis's Cross (the original can be seen in the museum). It stands on the spot where the townsmen fought off the attack by the ''Sternerbund'' in 1378. Further remnants of the town fortifications stand in the Lower Town (east side of the Old Town), among them the ''Klausturm'' (a watchtower and prison) and the somewhat smaller ''Pulverturm'' (\u201cPowder Tower\u201d)\n\nFurthermore, on Johannestor (a street) is found the ''Elisabeth-Hospital'', endowed in 1239, with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] chapel. Other Abbey buildings are the Schloss Eichhof and the ruins \u2013 the ''Bruderhaus'' \u2013 of the former Johannesberg provost's house. Both buildings lie some 3&nbsp;km from the Old Town and can also be reached on foot from the spa park.\n[[File:Hersfeld pfarrhaus.jpg|thumb|100px|Oldest [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house in Bad Hersfeld from 1452]]\n\nIn the centre of Bad Hersfeld's Old Town stands the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ''Stadtkirche'' (\u201cTown Church\u201d) whose 14th-century tower is the town's landmark. On the church square stands a continuous row of [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] buildings, among them the former ''K\u00fcsterhaus'' (sexton's house), which is the town's oldest timber-frame house, built in 1452. Right next to this stands the Town Hall, which was built about 1371 in the Gothic style and remodelled and expanded between 1607 and 1612 in the [[Weser Renaissance]] style. Further timber-frame houses are to be found throughout the [[pedestrian precinct]]. Particularly worthy of mention here is the richly decorated ''Zimmermannshaus'' (\u201cCarpenter\u2019s House\u201d) on Klausstra\u00dfe.\n\nOn Linggplatz, the Abbey's old court square (old stone \u201cdouble cross\u201d), a statue recalls [[Baden]] Lieutenant Colonel Johann Baptist Lingg von Linggenfeld, who saved the town from being burnt down by Napoleonic troops in 1807. Beside this lies the marketplace on which patrician houses from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] times stand, among them the old mint. They were remodelled in the [[Renaissance]] and bear witness, with their gables like the timber-frame houses across the street, to the monastery's last building boom. On the ''Neumarkt'' (\u201cNew Market\u201d) stands, besides the other timber-frame houses, the ''Linggklause'' (Lieutenant Colonel Lingg's dwelling). Here, too, are the old monastery school (nowadays the ''Konrad-Duden-Schule'') and the Konrad Duden Museum.\n\n=== Parks ===\nThe biggest park in town is the ''Kurpark'', or spa park (some 6.5&nbsp;ha) with the ''Kurhaus'' (spa house), the pump room and the spring pavilion. Right near the Old Town is found the ''Leonardt-M\u00fcller-Anlage'' (park), along the town wall, with the two ''Nordschulteiche'' (ponds). In the monastery zone is another park, which in 2006 was expanded with a perennial plant garden. Both the spa park and the ''Leonardt-M\u00fcller-Anlage'' were remodelled between 2006 and 2007.\n\nFurther greenspaces are the 15-hectare Fuldapark with its Fuldasee (lake) and the ''Carl-Strau\u00df-Anlage'' on the Kleinsh\u00f6he (heights) on the Tageberg.\n\n=== Sport ===\n*Besides the football clubs in many centres, there is the SVA Bad Hersfeld club, which with its first team is playing in the Fu\u00dfball-Verbandsliga Hessen Nord in the 2008/2009 season. The second team plays in the Bezirksliga Fulda Nord, and the A-Juniors belong, for the third year now, to the Hyundai Oberliga Hessen. Further ball sports are played at the Turnverein Hersfeld 1848 e. V. (gymnastic club). Among others, there are [[team handball]], [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]].\n*The team of the SG Hessen Hersfeld played from the 1997/1998 season until the 2002/2003 season in the women's Handball-Bundesliga.\n*The three rowing and canoe clubs, Hersfelder Kanu-Club 1924 e. V., Kanu-Wanderer Hersfeld 1986 e. V. and Hersfelder Ruderverein 1977 e. V. carry out their activity in the summer, mainly on the Fulda. The last-named club also engages in competitive rowing.\n*Besides the shooting clubs in almost every outlying centre, there is also the Hersfelder Sch\u00fctzengilde (\u201cMarksmen\u2019s Guild\u201d) 1252 e. V. It is one of Germany's oldest still-active clubs.\n*The Luftsportverein Bad Hersfeld e. V. ([[air sports]]) has its [[Glider aircraft|glider]] facility on the Langenberg near Hattenbach (a constituent community of [[Niederaula]]).\n\n=== Regular events ===\n[[File:Festspiele eroeffnung1 hersfeld.jpg|thumb|Opening of the ''Bad Hersfelder Festspiele'']]\n[[File:Hersfelder lullusfest lingplatz.jpg|thumb|left|''Lullusfest'']]\nNationally known are the yearly ''Bad Hersfelder Festspiele'', opera festival and the festival concerts. They are held between June and August in the monastery ruins. Other great musical events for every taste is the Bad Hersfeld [[Bach family|Bach]] Days event (every year at [[Easter]] at the Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus), the Live-[[Jazz]]-Festival (every year on the first weekend in June on stages throughout the Old Town), the ''StadtJugendNacht'' (\u201cTown Youth Night\u201d; yearly on the first Saturday in September under the ''Peterstorbr\u00fccke'' [bridge]) and the ''Metalfest'' (late every year).\n\nThe ''Lullusfest'' is known for being Germany's oldest folk festival. It is held every year in the week in which 16 October falls. Other greater folk festivals are the shooting festival of the marksmen's guild in the J\u00e4gersgraben and the Tagebergfest of the volunteer fire brigade (an outdoor forest festival).\n\nAmong sporting events that can be named are the ''Sauer Lollslauf'', a marathon run on the occasion of the ''Lullusfest'', and the ''Internationale Bad Hersfelder [[Deutscher Motorsport Verband|DMV]]-Grasbahnrennen'' held each summer by the Motorsportclub Bad Hersfeld e. V. on a 500&nbsp;m-long track.\n\nMost markets in town are held on Linggplatz. The weekly market is held twice a week and a flea market takes place from April to October on the first Saturday of each month. Other, yearly, markets are the Easter Market on Wednesday before Good Friday, the Whitsun Market on Wednesday before Whitsunday, the ''Gro\u00dfe Lulluskrammarkt'' (\u201cGreat Lullus Traders\u2019 Market\u201d) on Wednesday during ''Lullusfest'' and the Autumn Market on Penance Day, the Wednesday before 23 November (this day is known in Germany as ''[[Bu\u00df- und Bettag]]'', an [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] observance).\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nSince [[German reunification]] Bad Hersfeld has lain in the middle of Germany, favourably located on the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 7|A&nbsp;7]], leading the region to develop into a stronghold for logistics firms.\n\nThe town appears in Hesse's state development plan as a middle centre partly functioning as a higher centre. The town maintains a large volunteer fire brigade, which sometimes sees service elsewhere in Germany.\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n==== Highway ====\nThe north-south [[Autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&nbsp;5]] (Hattenbach\u2013[[Basel]]) and [[Bundesautobahn 7|A&nbsp;7]] ([[Flensburg]]\u2013[[F\u00fcssen]]) meet the east-west Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] ([[Aachen]]\u2013[[G\u00f6rlitz]]) at the Kirchheim and Hattenbach three-leg [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s.\n\nMoreover, the north-south ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 27 (from the [[Harz]] to [[Lake Constance]]) and the east-west ''Bundesstra\u00dfe'' 62 (from [[Marburg]] to [[Bad Salzungen]]) play an important role. ''Bundesstra\u00dfe'' 324 serves as an Autobahn feeder to the A&nbsp;7. All three ''Bundesstra\u00dfen'' meet each other in Bad Hersfeld.\n\n==== Railway ====\n[[File:KnuellwaldbahnHEF.JPG|thumb|A railway crossing at the ''Kurpark'' on the ''Kn\u00fcllwaldbahn'', nowadays only used for goods services]]\nBad Hersfeld lies on the [[Kassel]]\u2013[[Bebra]]\u2013[[Fulda]] [[railway]] line. There is an [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] connection every two hours from [[Frankfurt am Main]] by way of [[Fulda]] to [[Eisenach]]\u2013[[Erfurt]]\u2013[[Weimar]]\u2013[[Leipzig]]\u2013[[Berlin]]/[[Dresden]]. Regional trains run to, among other places, [[Kassel]] and [[G\u00f6ttingen]]. Just behind Hersfeld [[railway station]], the ''Kn\u00fcllwaldbahn'' branches off.\n\n==== Local public transport ====\nThe local public transport is run by the ''Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund'' (\u201cNorth Hesse Transport Association\u201d, NVV). The nine town and four intercity bus routes are run by \u00dcberlandwerk Fulda AG (\u00dcWAG Bus GmbH).\n\nThe ''Hersfelder Kreisbahn'' run by the ''Hersfelder Eisenbahngesellschaft'', a local railway line running from Bad Hersfeld to [[Philippsthal (Werra)|Philippsthal]] \u2013 roughly 11&nbsp;km \u2013 was abandoned in 1993, and the stretch as far as [[Schenklengsfeld]] has been converted into a cycling path.\n\n==== Air transport ====\nThe ''Flugplatz Johannesberg'' has the status of Special Airfield. The runway, some 671&nbsp;m long and 18&nbsp;m wide, is paved with asphalt and oriented in a north-south direction. The airfield lies on the Johannesberg in the like-named outlying centre at an elevation of 284&nbsp;m above [[sea level]].\n\nThe airfield was built by the [[United States Army]] between 1952 and 1953 and belonged to McPheeter Barracks in the outlying centre of Hohe Luft. It was known at that time as US Army Airfield Werve-Thompson. When the US Army pulled out in 1993, the airfield was taken over by Motor-Flieger-Club e.&nbsp;V. Bad Hersfeld.\n\n=== Established businesses ===\nAmong businesses in the oldest field of endeavour in Bad Hersfeld, textile manufacturing, is the firm Performance Fibers (formerly the [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] works, which makes high-strength [[polyester]] fibres. Further long-established family businesses are the mineral oil dealer and operator of the LOMO filling stations Lorenz Mohr GmbH & Co. KG and the building firm Kirchner Holding GmbH. Working in the field of electronics are EMS ([[Electronics manufacturing services|Electronic Manufacturing Services]]) service provider EN ElectronicNetwork Hersfeld GmbH (formerly Zuse KG, later [[Siemens]] AG, and KRONE Kommunikationstechnik GmbH) and Thales e-Transactions GmbH. In the field of machine building and process engineering, the firms Grenzebach BSH GmbH (in Schilde AG's old buildings), [[The Linde Group|Linde Ladenbau GmbH & Co. KG]] and TLT Turbo GmbH (since 2006 owned by Siemens AG) can be named. The logistics field settled here for the most part only after [[German reunification]]. After [[Amazon.com|amazon.de]] and Libri, a book wholesaling firm, came the logistics firm [[RS Components]], setting up its European hub in Bad Hersfeld.\n\nA further important economic factor is the hospital establishment, which in part also supports the spa operations. The following hospitals and clinics are to be found in town: the ''Klinikum Bad Hersfeld'' and the ''Krankenhaus St. Elisabeth Bad Hersfeld'', which are active mainly in general medicine, and the spa clinics ''Klinik im Kurpark'' (clinic for psychosomatic medicine and orthopaedics), ''Fachklinik Wigbertsh\u00f6he'' (clinic for sociopsychosomatic illnesses), ''Klinik am Hainberg'' (clinic for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy), ''Vitalisklinik'' (clinic for digestive and metabolic disorders) and the ''Orthop\u00e4dische Akutklinik''.\n\nThe biggest bank in town is the ''[[Sparkasse]] Bad Hersfeld-Rotenburg''.\n\n=== Music ===\nEach year after the ''Festspiele'', an opera festival is held in the monastery ruins. Even during the time of the ''Festspiele'', though, the ''Arbeitskreis f\u00fcr Musik e. V. '' (\u201cmusic workshop\u201d) has staged the ''Bad Hersfelder Festspielkonzerte'' in the monastery ruins, in the ''Stadthalle'' and at ''Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus'' since 1961. Furthermore, seasonal concerts are held the year round in the ''Stadthalle'' and at ''Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus''. Among them are<!--Grammar is correct; \u201cBachtage\u201d is PLURAL.-->  the ''Internationale Bachtage in Hessen und Th\u00fcringen'' at which each year during Holy Week and at Easter great choral works and chamber music extravaganzas are produced.\n\nAlso, each year on the first weekend in June is the jazz festival. National and international stars as well as groups from the town itself liven up the town the whole weekend long from morning until late evening with [[Swing music|swing]], [[Beat music|beat]] and [[blues]]. For many years this festival has been a great yearly highlight, drawing many visitors from all over.\n\nIn autumn, the yearly ''Cross Music Metalfest'' is held, at which many hard rock and metal bands from all over the world appear. It is always held on the first weekend in October and draws visitors from all over Europe.\n\n=== Media ===\nThe local daily newspaper is the ''Hersfelder Zeitung'' (founded in 1763) and the twice weekly advertising flier ''Kreisanzeiger'' has been distributed free since 1980. Both papers have belonged to the publishing business Dirk Ippen. Competition comes from an independent advertising flier published since August 2008, the ''Express Waldhessen''. Since several months the \"Express Waldhessen\" has a new name. It's called \"Klartext\". In addition sind 2004 there is another small Newspaper made by Bodo Neumann. It's called: \"EXTRABLATT\" which will be free distributed every 14 days.\n\nSince 1 May 2008, FunRadio Hersfeld<ref>FunRadio Hersfeld [http://www.FunRadio-Hersfeld.de Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006202542/http://funradio-hersfeld.de/ |date=2008-10-06 }}</ref> has been broadcasting from the town.\n\n=== Public institutions ===\nBesides the customary institutions usually found in a district seat, and those already described under \u201cCulture and sightseeing\u201d, there are the ''Stadthalle'' (literally \u201ctown hall\u201d, but actually an event venue, not connected at all with the town's administration; \u201ctown hall\u201d is ''Rathaus'' in [[German language|German]]), the book caf\u00e9 (sponsor: Verein f\u00fcr Kultur und Kommunikation e. V.) and the ''Konrad-Duden-Stadtbibliothek'' (town library). This was opened in March 1999 on the marketplace in Bad Hersfeld. The public library has a total floor area of some 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2. On 31 December 2007, it had an inventory of some 65,000 media, and yearly media borrowings amount to 210,000.\n\nIn the field of sport, there are two baths, the Aqua Fit (sport and family bath) and the Kurbad Therme ([[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] bath) at the spa park. Moreover, there is the heated [[swimming pool]] Geistalbad. Many other sports can be pursued at the Jahn-Park (sport and leisure centre), the [[Nordic walking|Nordic-Walking]]-Park and the sport and tennis grounds in Bad Hersfeld.\n\n==== Spa operations ====\n[[File:Kurpark bad hersfeld.jpg|thumb|Bad Hersfeld's ''Kurpark'' (\u201cspa park\u201d)]]\nIn Bad Hersfeld are two mineral springs. The ''Lullusquelle'' was newly bored in 1904. It was documented as early as 1518, but was overwhelmed in a flood in the 17th century. The ''Vitalisbrunnen'' was bored in 1949. The water is heavy with [[Sodium sulfate|Glauber's salt]].

From the 2011 Census the population of the village was not maintained and is included in the civil parish of [[Chelsworth]]. It derives its name from Kitelbeornastuna, (Kitelbjorn's farmstead - O.Scand. pers. name + O.E. Tun), later evolving to Kettlebarston, (which is how the name is still pronounced), and finally to the current spelling. Its existence was first recorded in 1086 in the ''[[Domesday Book]]''.\n\n==History==\nOnce in an area of great wealth, the demise of the [[mediaeval]] [[wool trade]] was indirectly the saving of the village, (as we know it today), since the locals were unable to afford the expense of upgrading their houses with the latest architectural fashions. The number of [[Timber framing|timber-framed house]]s slowly declined over the years, as did the population - from over 200 at its peak, to the point when the village was on the brink of extinction. By the 1960s, with the road no more than an unmade track, and no electricity or mains water supplies, (it still has no gas or main drains), Kettlebaston was barely standing. In the \"Spotlight On The Suffolk Scene\" article, of the ''Chronicle & Mercury'' in June 1949, it was noted that a great many houses were category five - derelict, and ready for demolition.\n\nAs the agricultural workers left the land in search of other jobs, due to the increased mechanisation of farm work, \"outsiders\" discovered the secluded beauty of the rural Suffolk countryside, and a new age dawned. The tiny workmen's cottages, which once housed huge families - and some stock and chickens according to local accounts - were lovingly renovated and converted, and the village was reborn, and went on to proudly win Babergh Best Kept Village, and runner up in the Suffolk Community Council Best Kept Village Competition, in 1989.\n\nThe village sign, bearing two crossed sceptres topped with doves, was erected to mark the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]]. It also commemorates that, in 1445, [[Henry VI, King of England|Henry VI]] granted the manor of Kettlebaston to [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk]], in return for the service of carrying a golden [[sceptre]] at the coronation of all the future Kings of England, and an ivory sceptre to carry at the coronation of [[Margaret of Anjou]], and all future Queens. This honour continued until [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] resumed the manor, although it was later regranted it was without the royal service.\n\n===Parish Church===\nThe parish church of St Mary the Virgin has [[Norman architecture|Norman]] origins, and features a [[baptismal font|font]] from around 1200. The building is  listed as Grade I.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1037253|desc=Church of St Mary|grade=I}}</ref> It is recorded that the church was then \"built anew\" in 1342, remaining largely unchanged until targeted by [[Protestant]] [[Iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] in the 1540s. Today it features one of Suffolk's finest post-Reformation [[rood screen]]s, designed by Father Ernest Geldart and decorated by Patrick Osborne, and Enid Chadwick, and a rare [[Sacred Heart]] altar upon a [[Stuart period|Stuart]] Holy Table. It now lacks the small lead spire which once topped the tower.\n\nRegarded as a place of [[pilgrimage]] to the followers of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] movement from all over the UK, Kettlebaston was the liturgically highest of all Suffolk's Anglican churches. From 1930, until his retirement in 1964, Reverend Father Harold Clear Butler said Roman Mass every day, and celebrated High Mass and Benediction on Sundays.

From the 2011 Census the population of the village was not maintained and is included in the civil parish of [[Chelsworth]]. It derives its name from Kitelbeornastuna, (Kitelbjorn's farmstead - O.Scand. pers. name + O.E. Tun), later evolving to Kettlebarston, (which is how the name is still pronounced), and finally to the current spelling. Its existence was first recorded in 1086 in the ''[[Domesday Book]]''.\n\n==History==\nOnce in an area of great wealth, the demise of the [[mediaeval]] [[wool trade]] was indirectly the saving of the village, (as we know it today), since the locals were unable to afford the expense of upgrading their houses with the latest architectural fashions. The number of [[Timber framing|timber-framed house]]s slowly declined over the years, as did the population - from over 200 at its peak, to the point when the village was on the brink of extinction. By the 1960s, with the road no more than an unmade track, and no electricity or mains water supplies, (it still has no gas or main drains), Kettlebaston was barely standing. In the \"Spotlight On The Suffolk Scene\" article, of the ''Chronicle & Mercury'' in June 1949, it was noted that a great many houses were category five - derelict, and ready for demolition.\n\nAs the agricultural workers left the land in search of other jobs, due to the increased mechanisation of farm work, \"outsiders\" discovered the secluded beauty of the rural Suffolk countryside, and a new age dawned. The tiny workmen's cottages, which once housed huge families - and some stock and chickens according to local accounts - were lovingly renovated and converted, and the village was reborn, and went on to proudly win Babergh Best Kept Village, and runner up in the Suffolk Community Council Best Kept Village Competition, in 1989.\n\nThe village sign, bearing two crossed sceptres topped with doves, was erected to mark the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]]. It also commemorates that, in 1445, [[Henry VI, King of England|Henry VI]] granted the manor of Kettlebaston to [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk]], in return for the service of carrying a golden [[sceptre]] at the coronation of all the future Kings of England, and an ivory sceptre to carry at the coronation of [[Margaret of Anjou]], and all future Queens. This honour continued until [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] resumed the manor, although it was later regranted it was without the royal service.\n\nThe parish church of St Mary the Virgin has [[Norman architecture|Norman]] origins, and features a [[baptismal font|font]] from around 1200. The building is  listed as Grade I.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1037253|desc=Church of St Mary|grade=I}}</ref> It is recorded that the church was then \"built anew\" in 1342, remaining largely unchanged until targeted by [[Protestant]] [[Iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] in the 1540s. Today it features one of Suffolk's finest post-Reformation [[rood screen]]s, designed by Father Ernest Geldart and decorated by Patrick Osborne, and Enid Chadwick, and a rare [[Sacred Heart]] altar upon a [[Stuart period|Stuart]] Holy Table. It now lacks the small lead spire which once topped the tower.\n\nRegarded as a place of [[pilgrimage]] to the followers of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] movement from all over the UK, Kettlebaston was the liturgically highest of all Suffolk's Anglican churches. From 1930, until his retirement in 1964, Reverend Father Harold Clear Butler said Roman Mass every day, and celebrated High Mass and Benediction on Sundays. He also removed state notices from the porch, and refused to keep registers, or to recognise the office of the local [[Archdeacon of Sudbury]]. Despite opposition, the church finally received electric heating and lighting in 2014.\n\nThe current village has no shop, school, or pub.\n\n==Notable residents==\n*[[Patrick Murdoch]] ( -1774); author, publisher and mathematician.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Kettlebaston}}\n*[http://www.kettlebaston.com/ '''Kettlebaston Online''' (incorporating the Y2K Project).

Its 1993 congress in [[Mauritius]] attempted to lay out a concrete strategy for responding to business attacks on organized labour around the world.

Delegates to an October congress in [[Brussels]] voted to reject the invitation, on the grounds that the WFTU's global unity was \"too artificial\".<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nThe matter of affiliation with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU) is in dispute.

In 1959, the IFCTU convened a seminar in [[Saigon]] to determine the possibilities for points of unity among world religions in matters of social behaviour.<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nIn 1968, delegates to the organization's 16th congress in [[Luxembourg]] voted to transform it into the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). Breaking with the federation's strictly Christian ideology of the past, the newly adopted Declaration of Principles stated it would henceforth be guided by \"either a spiritual concept based on the conviction that man and universe are created by God, or other concepts that lead together with it to a common effort to build a human community united in freedom, dignity, justice and brotherhood.\"<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\n===Globalization and ITUC merger===\nAs [[globalization]] became more of a threat to union membership throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the WCL increased its efforts to carry out a similar global unification of labour leadership. Its 1993 congress in [[Mauritius]] attempted to lay out a concrete strategy for responding to business attacks on organized labour around the world. The WCL soon obtained consultative status within the [[International Labour Organization]] and joined the International Council of the [[World Social Forum]].<ref name=\"wclhistory\"/>\n\nThe WCL was formally dissolved on 31 October 2006 when it merged with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU) to form the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC).\n\n==Areas of activity==\nThe WCL had nine areas of labour activity where it focused work.\n\n===Human rights and international labour standards===\nThe WCL worked to enforce respect for international law, especially as codified by the ILO.
