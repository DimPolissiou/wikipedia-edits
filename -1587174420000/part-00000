The programme prepared students for the intermediate examinations of the Town Planning Institute of [[Great Britain]]. After passing the intermediate examination, students were sent to universities in Great Britain to obtain full professional qualifications. In 1961, the [[United Nations]] assisted the [[Government of Ghana]] to establish an Institute for Community Planning on the Campus of [[Kumasi College of Arts, Science and Technology]]. The objective of the institute was to train and educate planners at the sub-professional level.  Students who completed the two-year programme were awarded [[Diplomas]] of the Institute.  It had an annual intake of 20 students.\n\nIn 1963, the Institute for Community Planning was absorbed by the newly created [[Faculty of Architecture of the Kumasi College]], whose status had been raised a year earlier to that of a [[university]].  The duration of the diploma programme was extended to three years by the faculty. The programme was discontinued in 1977 because applicants for the programme tended to have the same qualification as those admitted to the degree course.\n\nWithin the first decade, the faculty instituted a new programme leading to a [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc.) Degree in Design in the new [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]].  The programme permitted graduates to pursue postgraduate degrees in Architecture, Planning or Building Technologies, but the idea of a combined first degree for all three fields was not very successful because most of the graduating students opted for architecture, the more lucrative practice.  As a result, separate undergraduate degrees in the three professional fields were instituted in 1969 with a first year programme structured for all the disciplines. A B.Sc. Planning Degree Programme was commenced that year.  \n  \nAfter a decade, the M.Sc. DEPP Programme became competitive to the point that the Academic Board approved a \"sandwich\" version of the programme for those who were not able to enroll as regular students. The sandwich version of the programme increased the number of graduates who could be trained in Development Policy and planning; and assisted potential students who might not be able to leave their jobs for two continuous years to pursue graduate education in the programme; introduced the first self finance graduate Programme in the Department of Planning; and accelerated the process of graduating students to fill the gap between development policy and development planning in Ghana.\n\nIn 1985, the department established a joint postgraduate programme in Development Planning and Managementin collaboration with the Department of Spatial Planning, [[University of Dortmund]] in [[Germany]]. Codenamed SPRING (\u201cSpatial Planning for Regions in Growing Economies\u201d), the two-year programme initially required international attendance, with the first year spent at Dortmund and the second in Ghana. In 2003, this changed so that the entire two years were served in Ghana. An average of 10 students per year, drawn from all over Africa, participate in the programme.\n\nThe 1990s saw considerable restructuring. First, in the 1994/1995 academic year, the new modified Master of Science (M.Sc.) Programme in Regional Development Planning was launched. Created in 1964, the programme had been suspended in 1984 to permit reorganization. 1997 saw the restructuring of the M. Phil. Programme in Development Studies, which had been established in 1980. Created to provide opportunity for candidates graduating from the B.Sc. Planning Degree Programme, the programme was enlarged to give opportunity to candidates with knowledge in development planning related sciences and disciplines. As a result, two new M.Phil Programmes were created: M. Phil in Planning and M. Phil in Development Studies. At the same time, two streams of PhD Programmes were established: the Ph.D in Planning and Ph.D in Development Studies.\n\nThe following year, another international collaboration in learning and research came into fruition when an agreement was reached between the Department of Human Settlements; the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]; the Department of Planning, [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]]; and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], [[DANIDA]], concerning DANIDA\u2019s support of a research assistant to a project at the Department.  The project, \u201cCommunity Initiatives and Democratization of Planning Practice in Ghana\u201d, dubbed ENRECA Project has since been offering support to the MPhil Planning Programme.\n\n==Mission and goals==\nThe Department\u2019s mission is to train skilled personnel required to formulate and manage various development policies and programmes at all levels of national development. Examples of such policies and programmes include the National Vision of Socio-Economic Development which is required by the [[Constitution of Ghana|1992 Constitution]], the economic management programme, the Poverty Reduction Strategies and the ongoing decentralization policy.\n\nThe department\u2019s policy is to:\n* augment its service to government and the nation in development planning and administration with particular reference to national economic management, decentralization and accelerated growth strategy;\n*To limit the need to rely upon out-of-country resources for postgraduate studies; and\n*To offer programmes on an all\u2013Africa basis to provide an international centre for planning education and to generate income for the department.\n\nIn line with national objectives for tertiary education and the university expectations, the department aims to provide cost-effective training of its students  and to increase access for women at all levels.<ref name=\"KNUST_Department of Planning - Statements of Objectives\">{{cite web |url=http://www.knust.edu.gh/pages/sections.php?siteid=planning&mid=248&sid=815 |title=KNUST - Department of Planning (DoP)- Statements of Objectives |accessdate=2009-10-30 |work=Official Website |publisher=KNUST Department of Planning (DoP) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230949/http://www.knust.edu.gh/pages/sections.php?siteid=planning&mid=248&sid=815 |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It also seeks to provide training through [[continuing education]] to individuals already in service in sectoral ministries, Regional Coordinating Councils, District Assemblies, parastatals, and private sector organizations including [[NGO]]\u2019s.

The battle is also known as the \"Battle for the Wounded on the Neretva\" or simply the \"Battle for the Wounded\".\n\n== Location ==\nThe bridge is part of the historical cultural landscape, that houses the Museum of the Battle for the Wounded on the Neretva river, in town of Jablanica, and number of smaller memorial sites and monuments, scattered across the municipality Jablanica and neighboring municipalities territories. The museum was opened by [[Josip Broz Tito]] on 12 November 1978 to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the battle. It has been proclaimed a [[national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. <ref name=\"Spomenik\">{{Cite web|url=http://aplikacija.kons.gov.ba/kons/public/uploads/odluke_bos/Jablanica_Muzej%20Bitka%20za%20ranj%20BOS.pdf|title=Most u Jablanici|website=Komisija za o\u010duvanje nacionalnih spomenika BiH|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Bridge history and constructive elements ==\n[[File:Narrow-Gauge-Railway Narentabahn Jablanica Bridge (2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Famous bridge's original structure before it was blown up by Partisans.]]\n[[File:Prelaz partizana preko Neretve.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Partisans crossing the Neretva by climbing over the broken part of the bridge on the left bank.]]\n[[File:Neretva most.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Destroyed bridge on the [[Neretva]], today a part of the memorial complex, was twice-built and twice-destroyed during its history, hence the structural deviation from the original.]]\n[[File:Jablanica - Battle at the Neretva (5).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Memorial complex today, with bridge structure altered for the purpose of film production.]]\nThe bridge was built in 1888. The iron-lattice structure was first commissioned and made in Hungary and was planned to bridge the Neretva river in Jablanica. By mistake, it was made shorter by 4 meters, so it was moved to Mostar and installed as the Bridge of Emperor and King [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. A new bridge for Jablanica was commissioned in England and later erected. The bridge that was built in 1888, with a linear grid and an inverted arch on the underside of the bridge. The arch range was 78 m and the ''arch arrow'' was 10 m. It was supported by stone-built walls on both banks, and the depth of the bridge iron-lattice structure at the points of support was 3 meters.\n\nBetween 1-4 March 1943, the Partisans demolished all the bridges on the Neretva and [[Rama (Neretva)|Rama]], from Karaula to Ostro\u017eac. Between 7-8 March, in just 18 hours, a wooden provisional bridge, 56 m long and 2.5 m wide, was built.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans built a new bridge, which was a spatial grid of rectangular cross-section. The span of the bridge was 78 m and the height of the grid 8 m. The width of the bridge was 5 m. The bridge relied on existing stone-built supports. The grid height at the support points was smaller and was 5 m on either side of the bridge. This bridge was again demolished in 1968 during the filming of the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated film \"[[Battle of Neretva (film)|Battle on the Neretva]]\" by director [[Veljko Bulaji\u0107]].\n\nAs part of the project for the Museum of the Battle for the Wounded on the Neretva River in Jablanica, a reconstruction project for the Memorial Bridge was completed in May 1977. The existing latticework of the demolished railway bridge, which after its demolition in 1968 fell to the left bank of the Neretva, has remained to this day with the necessary works on protection against further collapse and deterioration.\n\nThe bridging of the Neretva river between the pedestrian paths on the right bank toward the existing part laying on the left bank is done by a construction of the missing part of the bridge. This new part is placed from the right bank almost horizontally, with a slight slant towards the part of the bridge on the left bank, and is attached to the new concrete foundations in the Neretva riverbed and on the slope of the right bank. Along the new part of the bridge, wooden transverse beams are laid upstream, over which there is a wooden bridge floor.

Bridge is part of the Memorial of the [[Case White|Battle on the Neretva]] dedicated to the famous [[World War II]] battle, fought between [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisans]] and [[Axis powers|Axes forces]], as part of the 4th Enemy Offensive in February-March 1943. The battle is also known as the \"Battle for the Wounded on the Neretva\" or simply the \"Battle for the Wounded\".\n\n== Location ==\nThe bridge is part of the historical cultural landscape, that houses the Museum of the Battle for the Wounded on the Neretva river, in town of Jablanica, and number of smaller memorial sites and monuments, scattered across the municipality Jablanica and neighboring municipalities territories. The museum was opened by [[Josip Broz Tito]] on 12 November 1978 to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the battle. It has been proclaimed a [[national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. <ref name=\"Spomenik\">{{Cite web|url=http://aplikacija.kons.gov.ba/kons/public/uploads/odluke_bos/Jablanica_Muzej%20Bitka%20za%20ranj%20BOS.pdf|title=Most u Jablanici|website=Komisija za o\u010duvanje nacionalnih spomenika BiH|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Bridge history and constructive elements ==\n[[File:Narrow-Gauge-Railway Narentabahn Jablanica Bridge (2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Famous bridge's original structure before it was blown up by Partisans.]]\n[[File:Prelaz partizana preko Neretve.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Partisans crossing the Neretva river by climbing over the the broken part of the bridge on the left bank.]]\n[[File:Neretva most.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Destroyed bridge, today a part of the memorial complex, with its structure altered for the purpose of film production.]]\n[[File:Jablanica - Battle at the Neretva (5).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Memorial complex today, bridge on the [[Neretva]] was twice-built and twice-destroyed during its history, hence the structural deviation from the original.]]\nThe bridge was built in 1888. The iron-lattice structure was first commissioned and made in Hungary and was planned to bridge the Neretva river in Jablanica. By mistake, it was made shorter by 4 meters, so it was moved to Mostar and installed as the Bridge of Emperor and King [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. A new bridge for Jablanica was commissioned in England and later erected. The bridge that was built in 1888, with a linear grid and an inverted arch on the underside of the bridge. The arch range was 78 m and the ''arch arrow'' was 10 m. It was supported by stone-built walls on both banks, and the depth of the bridge iron-lattice structure at the points of support was 3 meters.\n\nBetween 1-4 March 1943, the Partisans demolished all the bridges on the Neretva and [[Rama (Neretva)|Rama]], from Karaula to Ostro\u017eac. Between 7-8 March, in just 18 hours, a wooden provisional bridge, 56 m long and 2.5 m wide, was built.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans built a new bridge, which was a spatial grid of rectangular cross-section. The span of the bridge was 78 m and the height of the grid 8 m. The width of the bridge was 5 m. The bridge relied on existing stone-built supports. The grid height at the support points was smaller and was 5 m on either side of the bridge. This bridge was again demolished in 1968 during the filming of the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated film \"[[Battle of Neretva (film)|Battle on the Neretva]]\" by director [[Veljko Bulaji\u0107]].\n\nAs part of the project for the Museum of the Battle for the Wounded on the Neretva River in Jablanica, a reconstruction project for the Memorial Bridge was completed in May 1977. The existing latticework of the demolished railway bridge, which after its demolition in 1968 fell to the left bank of the Neretva, has remained to this day with the necessary works on protection against further collapse and deterioration.\n\nThe bridging of the Neretva river between the pedestrian paths on the right bank toward the existing part laying on the left bank is done by a construction of the missing part of the bridge. This new part is placed from the right bank almost horizontally, with a slight slant towards the part of the bridge on the left bank, and is attached to the new concrete foundations in the Neretva riverbed and on the slope of the right bank. Along the new part of the bridge, wooden transverse beams are laid upstream, over which there is a wooden bridge floor. This wooden part of the memorial was used by visitors to cross from right to left bank, echoing and honoring crossing during the battle.\n\nHowever, in 1991, the swollen Neretva river ripped off entire new section of the bridge, both steel and wooden elements. A major reconstruction project has been prepared and the [[Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine|Bosnia and Herzegovina Electricity Company]] pledged to finance and work to rebuild the bridge.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe 1969 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated motion picture ''[[The Battle of Neretva]]'' depicts these events.\n\n[[Alistair MacLean]]'s 1968 thriller novel ''[[Force 10 From Navarone]]'', subsequently filmed, also brings forth the fight of outnumbered Partisans against Germans and [[Chetniks]], and the blowing up of the Neretva bridge.

It was founded in 2006 and has eleven constituents.\n\n==History==\nThe establishment of the Juraj Dobrila University of Pula at the beginning of 21st century is an important part of the restructuring of the [[List of universities in Croatia|Croatian system of higher education]]. Grouping the institutions of higher education in an autonomous university and establishing the department-type university has been a complex project. The foundation of the University of Pula takes into consideration the historical and cultural assumptions of location and development of [[Istria]] in past centuries. Historical-traditional, training-educational and other assumptions of cultural development are important factors for founding the University of Pula.\n\nThe 1950s in Istria were marked with the thought of getting more people into higher education, especially into economic and teacher professions. Two prominent Istrian intellectuals, [[Mijo Mirkovi\u0107]] and [[Tone Peru\u0161ko]], gave the decisive impulse of forming that point of view. The first two-year economic college (''Higher School of Economics'') was opened due to Mirkovi\u0107 contribution in the academic year 1960/61, and in 1961/62 Peru\u0161ko contributed by opening the Pedagogic Academy. Peru\u0161ko was also the first head-master of the academy. The Higher School of Economics developed into the Faculty of Economics and Tourism \"Dr. Mijo Mirkovi\u0107\", and the Pedagogic Academy into the Faculty of Philosophy in Pula and teacher training college in Pula. Mijo Mirkovi\u0107 suggested the establishment of an Adriatic University which would have consisted of faculties with seats in the major cities on the coast.\n\nThe opening of the two higher education institutions in Istria at the beginning of the 1960s was logical consequence derived from the envisaged future of the area. The idea was based on the two main directions of development: economy and education. In the second half of the 20th century this way of development did not change radically. These directions are currently still the major ones, but with specialities in many new courses nowadays. The study of economics now comprises three courses: finance, marketing and tourism. The study of educational sciences does not only offer a teacher training study, which had the longest tradition, but also offers new studies that appeared recently ([[Croatian language]] and [[Croatian literature|literature]], [[Italian language]] and [[Italian literature|literature]], history, [[Latin language]] and [[Roman literature]]). These new studies cover schooling necessary for teachers and enabling employment in other services. Restructuring institutions of higher education and opening new studies and courses was meant to enhance the potential of higher education in Istria.\n\nThe Juraj Dobrila University of Pula was officially founded on 29 September 2006 when the [[Croatian Parliament]] passed the Act of Founding the University of Pula. The University of Pula was entered in the Register of the Commercial Court in [[Pazin]] on 21 December 2006, thus acquiring its legal status.\n\n== Constituents of the University ==\n\nThe Juraj Dobrila University of Pula is an entirely integrated university, consisting of the following constituents:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unipu.hr/dokumenti/osnivanje_dopusnica_i_statut|title=Osnivanje, dopusnica i Statut \u2013 Sveu\u010dili\u0161te Jurja Dobrile u Puli|website=unipu.hr|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n*Academy of Music in Pula\n*Department of Engineering\n*Department of Natural and Health Sciences\n*[[Faculty of Economics and Tourism \"Dr. Mijo Mirkovi\u0107\"]]\n*Faculty of Educational Sciences\n*Faculty of Humanities\n*Faculty of Informatics\n*Faculty of Interdisciplinary, Italian and Cultural Studies\n*Institute for Science and Technology VISIO\n*Student Centre Pula\n*University Library\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of colleges and universities]]\n* [[Pula]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Juraj Dobrila University, Pula}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150413084655/http://www.unipu.hr/index.php?L=1 University of Pula Website] {{in lang|hr}}\n* [http://www.pula.hr Info Pula] {{in lang|hr}}\n\n{{Cro_Uni}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pula, University of}}\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Pula|University]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2006]]\n[[Category:2006 establishments in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges formed by merger]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox university\n| name              = Juraj Dobrila University of Pula\n| native_name       = Sveu\u010dili\u0161te Jurja Dobrile u Puli\n| latin_name        = Universitas studiorum Polensis Georgii Dobrila\n| image_name        = Pula University.JPG\n| image_size        = 200px\n| logo        = Juraj Dobrila University of Pula Logo.png\n| established       = 2006\n| type              = [[public university|public]]\n| endowment         = 41.156.863 [[Croatian kuna|HRK]] (2012)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.hr/hr/content/download/233003/3419291/file/61.%20-%201.1.a.pdf |accessdate=13 October 2013 |title=Prijedlog izmjena i dopuna Dr\u017eavnog prora\u010duna Republike Hrvatske za 2012. godinu |publisher=[[Government of the Republic of Croatia]] |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014130215/http://www.vlada.hr/hr/content/download/233003/3419291/file/61.%20-%201.1.a.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}</ref>\n| rector            = [[Alfio Barbieri]]\n| academic_staff    = 162<ref name=\"Sveu\u010dili\u0161ni godi\u0161njak 2012.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unipu.hr/uploads/media/godisnjak-12-13.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2013 |title=Sveu\u010dili\u0161ni godi\u0161njak 2012. |publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161te Jurja Dobrile u Puli |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104023422/http://www.unipu.hr/uploads/media/godisnjak-12-13.pdf |archivedate= 4 November 2013 }}</ref>\n| administrative_staff = 82<ref name=\"Sveu\u010dili\u0161ni godi\u0161njak 2012.\" />\n| students          = 2.465<ref name=\"Studenti u 2011./2012.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/publication/2012/SI-1473.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2013|title=Statisti\u010dka izvje\u0161\u0107a: Studenti u akademskoj godini 2011./2012. |publisher=Dr\u017eavni zavod za statistiku Republike Hrvatske|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| undergrad         = 2.367<ref name=\"Studenti u 2011./2012.\" />\n| postgrad          = 77<ref name=\"Studenti u 2011./2012.\" />\n| doctoral          = 20<ref name=\"Studenti u 2011./2012.\" />\n| other             = 1<ref name=\"Studenti u 2011./2012.\" />\n| city              = [[Pula]]\n| country           = [[Croatia]]\n| coor              = {{Coord|44.867291|13.854044|region:HR-18_type:edu_scale:5000|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| campus            = urban\n| affiliations      = [[Euromed Permanent University Forum|EPUF]]<br>[[Danube Rectors' Conference|DRC]]\n| website           = [https://www.unipu.hr/en www.unipu.hr]\n}}\nThe '''[[Juraj Dobrila]] University of Pula''' ({{lang-hr|Sveu\u010dili\u0161te Jurja Dobrile u Puli}}, {{lang-la|Universitas studiorum Polensis Georgii Dobrila}}) is a university in [[Pula]], Croatia.

Mijo Mirkovi\u0107 suggested the establishment of an Adriatic University which would have consisted of faculties with seats in the major cities on the coast.\n\nThe opening of the two higher education institutions in Istria at the beginning of the 1960s was logical consequence derived from the envisaged future of the area. The idea was based on the two main directions of development: economy and education. In the second half of the 20th century this way of development did not change radically. These directions are currently still the major ones, but with specialities in many new courses nowadays. The study of economics now comprises three courses: finance, marketing and tourism. The study of educational sciences does not only offer a teacher training study, which had the longest tradition, but also offers new studies that appeared recently ([[Croatian language]] and [[Croatian literature|literature]], [[Italian language]] and [[Italian literature|literature]], history, [[Latin language]] and [[Roman literature]]). These new studies cover schooling necessary for teachers and enabling employment in other services. Restructuring institutions of higher education and opening new studies and courses was meant to enhance the potential of higher education in Istria.\n\nThe Juraj Dobrila University of Pula was officially founded on 29 September 2006 when the [[Croatian Parliament]] passed the Act of Founding the University of Pula. The University of Pula was entered in the Register of the Commercial Court in [[Pazin]] on 21 December 2006, thus acquiring its legal status.\n\n== Constituents of the University ==\n\nThe Juraj Dobrila University of Pula is an entirely integrated university, consisting of the following constituents<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unipu.hr/dokumenti/osnivanje_dopusnica_i_statut|title=Osnivanje, dopusnica i Statut \u2013 Sveu\u010dili\u0161te Jurja Dobrile u Puli|website=unipu.hr|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref>:\n\n*Academy of Music in Pula\n*Department of Engineering\n*Department of Natural and Health Sciences\n*[[Faculty of Economics and Tourism \"Dr. Mijo Mirkovi\u0107\"]]\n*Faculty of Educational Sciences\n*Faculty of Humanities\n*Faculty of Informatics\n*Faculty of Interdisciplinary, Italian and Cultural Studies\n*Institute for Science and Technology VISIO\n*Student Centre Pula\n*University Library\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of colleges and universities]]\n* [[Pula]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commonscat-inline|Juraj Dobrila University, Pula}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150413084655/http://www.unipu.hr/index.php?L=1 University of Pula Website] {{in lang|hr}}\n* [http://www.pula.hr Info Pula] {{in lang|hr}}\n\n{{Cro_Uni}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pula, University of}}\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Pula|University]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2006]]\n[[Category:2006 establishments in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges formed by merger]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juraj_Dobrila_University_of_Pula"}
