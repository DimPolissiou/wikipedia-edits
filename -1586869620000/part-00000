Hart]] and [[Malia Scotch Marmo]]. It stars [[Robin Williams]] as [[Peter Pan|Peter Banning / Peter Pan]], [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Captain Hook]], [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Tinker Bell]], [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mr. Smee]] and [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Wendy Darling|Granny Wendy]]. It acts as a [[sequel]] to [[J. M. Barrie]]'s  1911 novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''  focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood. In his new life, he is known as Peter Banning, a successful but unimaginative and workaholic accountant with a wife (Wendy's granddaughter) and two children. However, when Captain Hook, the enemy of his past, kidnaps his children, he returns to [[Neverland]] to save them. Along the journey, he reclaims the memories of his past and becomes a better person.\n\nSpielberg began developing the film in the early 1980s with [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], which would have followed the storyline seen in the 1924 [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|silent film]] and 1953 [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|animated Disney film]]. It entered [[pre-production]] in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. [[James V. Hart]] developed the script with director [[Nick Castle]] and [[TriStar Pictures]] before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. It was shot almost entirely on [[sound stage]]s at [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]]. \n\nReleased on December 11, 1991, ''Hook'' received mixed reviews from critics, and while it was a commercial success, its box office take was lower than expected. Spielberg himself later admitted that he was disappointed with the final film. It has gained a strong cult following since its release.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roshanian|first=Arya|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/hook-cast-reunion-robin-williams-film-turns-25-anniversary-lost-boys-1201834867/|title=\u2018Hook\u2019 Reunion: Lost Boys Remember Robin Williams as Film Turns 25|work=Variety|date=August 10, 2016}}</ref> It was nominated in five categories at the [[64th Academy Awards]]. It also spawned merchandise, including [[#Video games|video games]], [[action figures]], and comic book adaptations.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Corporate lawyer]] Peter Banning is unaware his [[workaholic]] lifestyle in [[San Francisco]] is straining his relationship with his wife Moira and their children Jack and Maggie. As the family prepare to fly to London to visit Moria's grandmother [[Wendy Darling]], Peter focuses on completing his work before leaving, inadvertently missing Jack's baseball game. In London, Peter berates his children while conducting more work, causing Moira to argue with him and throw out his cell phone. That evening, Peter, Moira and Wendy attend a charity dinner in Wendy's honor, leaving her old friend [[Tootles]] and her housekeeper Liza watching over the children. When the group return, they find the house ransacked and the children missing, with a ransom note left behind supposedly written by [[Captain Hook|Captain James Hook]]. Although Peter involves the authorities in the matter, Wendy stipulates they cannot help, and that the note's writer is real, claiming Peter is really [[Peter Pan]].\n\nPeter refuses to believe this, but is surprised when drinking in the nursery to encounter [[Tinker Bell]], who uses her pixie dust to bring him to [[Neverland]]. Tinker Bell drops Peter within the ranks of Hook's pirates, whereupon he attempts to rescue his children after seeing Hook displaying them to his crew. Surprised to see Peter, Hook challenges him to fly and rescue his children, but upon seeing he cannot, prepares to execute him. Tinker Bell persuades Hook to let him go instead, promising to bring him back when he has his skills for a climactic battle in three days, vowing that if he wins, Hook will return his children to him. Peter finds himself taken to the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]], who have been led by Rufio following Pan's absence. Although they initially scoff at the idea that he is Peter Pan, Tinker Bell helps him prove himself by making him use his imagination to restore some of his abilities, although Rufio remains unimpressed.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Mr. Smee]] suggests to Hook to try to turn Peter's children against him. Although this tactic does not work with Maggie, Jack is swayed due to his father's failure to attend his games. Hook then has the pirates play a game of baseball, which Peter spies on while trying to steal his hook. Horrified to see Hook convert Jack to follow him, Peter forces himself to remember who he is, and finds himself brought back to the treehouse by Tinker Bell, where Wendy and her brothers stayed in alongside Pan and the Lost Boys. Once there, Peter begins recalling his lost memories, remembering how he came to Neverland as an infant, thanks to Tinker Bell, and his adventures with the Darling children. He finally recalls that he frequently returned to see Wendy, after the Darlings returned to London, until she had grown old, whereupon he stayed behind after falling in love with her daughter Moira.\n\nRecalling the day of Jack's birth, Peter finds a strong happy thought that restores his power to fly, and bringing him back as Peter Pan. Shocked that he is, Rufio turns over his sword to him, whereupon Pan and the Lost Boys arrive to fight Hook and his pirates as promised. As Peter fights his old nemesis, Jack realizes what Hook has been doing and returns to supporting his father. While Peter focuses on rescuing Maggie, Rufio engages Hook in a sword fight but is fatally stabbed. Angered by Hook's vows to continue coming after Peter's children, Peter engages him in a one-on-one sword fight, whereupon he defeats him and leaves him to be devoured by the taxidermied [[crocodile]], after it briefly reanimates and collapses on him. While asking Tinker Bell to take his children home, Peter reveals he is too old to stay, and appoints his successor amongst the Lost Boys before returning to London.\n\nPeter awakens in [[Kensington Gardens]] with the belief he was dreaming, but is surprised to see Mr. Smee cleaning up bottles nearby. Seeing Tinker Bell waiting nearby, Peter tearfully bids her farewell before returning to Wendy's house. Reuniting with his family, Peter decides to change his life, and abandons his job in order to devote more time to his family. Realizing he was given something before leaving, Peter hands over to Tootles his lost bag of marbles, whereupon he joyfully shakes it in delight and gets sprinkled in pixie dust. As the family watch him flying out of the house, Peter admits to Wendy that his adventures are not yet over as he hugs his family and they watch Tootles begin his flight to Neverland.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast: top 10 per tombstone closing credits order, remaining order and credited roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{see also|Characters of Peter Pan}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Peter Pan|Peter Banning / Peter Pan]]\n** Ryan Francis as teenage Peter Pan\n** Max Hoffman as young Peter Pan\n** Matthew Van Ginkel as baby Peter Pan\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Captain James Hook]]\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Tinker Bell]]\n** [[Lisa Wilhoit]] as Tinker Bell in a flashback in which Peter is a baby\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mr. Smee|Smee]]/Sweeper in Kensington Gardens\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Wendy Darling|Granny Wendy]]\n** [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as teenage Wendy Darling\n* [[Charlie Korsmo]] as Jack\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Moira\n* [[Dante Basco]] as Rufio\n* Amber Scott as Maggie\n* [[Jasen Fisher]] as Ace\n* [[Laurel Cronin]] as Liza, Granny Wendy's maid\n* [[Phil Collins]] as Inspector Good\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as Tootles\n* Isaiah Robinson as Pockets\n* Raushan Hammond as Thud Butt\n* [[James Madio]] as Don't Ask\n* Thomas Tulak as Too Small\n* Alex Zuckerman as Latchboy\n* Ahmad Stoner as No Nap\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn addition, a number of celebrities and family members made brief credited and uncredited cameos in the film:<ref name=Cameos>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/the-boy-who-inspired-hook-and-19-more-facts-as-film-turns-25-photos/ |title=The Boy Who Inspired \u2018Hook\u2019 and 19 Other Little-Known Facts as Film Turns 25 (Photos) |last=Doty |first=Meriah |date=December 11, 2016 |website=[[TheWrap]] |publisher= |access-date=October 12, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> musicians [[David Crosby]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]], as well as [[Academy Awards|Oscar-nominated]] actress [[Glenn Close]] and former [[NFL]] player [[Tony Burton]], appear as members of Hook's pirate crew; two major ''[[Star Wars]]'' associates, [[George Lucas]] and [[Carrie Fisher]], play the kissing couple sprinkled with [[pixie dust]]; two of Hoffman's children, [[Jake Hoffman|Jacob]] and Rebecca, both under 10-years-old during filming, briefly appeared in scenes in the \"normal\" world; screenwriter Jim Hart's 11-year-old son Jake, who years earlier inspired his father with the question \"What if Peter Pan grew up?\", plays one of Pan's Lost Boys.\n\n==Production==\n===Inspiration===\nSpielberg found a close personal connection to Peter Pan's story from his own childhood. The troubled relationship between Peter and Jack in the sequel echoed Spielberg's relationship with his own father. Previous Spielberg films that explored a dysfunctional father-son relationship included ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Peter's \"quest for success\" paralleled Spielberg starting out as a [[film director]] and transforming into a Hollywood [[business magnate]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=413}} \"I think a lot of people today are losing their imagination because they are work-driven. They are so self-involved with work and success and arriving at the next plateau that children and family almost become incidental. I have even experienced it myself when I have been on a very tough shoot and I've not seen my kids except on weekends. They ask for my time and I can't give it to them because I'm working.\"<ref name=beetle/> Like Peter at the beginning of the film, Spielberg has a [[fear of flying]]. He feels that Peter's \"enduring quality\" in the storyline is simply to fly. \"Anytime anything flies, whether it's [[Superman]], [[Batman]], or E.T., it's got to be a tip of the hat to Peter Pan,\" Spielberg reflected in a 1992 interview. \"''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' was the first time I saw anybody fly. Before I saw Superman, before I saw Batman, and of course before I saw any [[superhero]]es, my first memory of anybody flying is in ''Peter Pan''.\"<ref name=beetle/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe genesis of the film started when Spielberg's mother often read him ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' as a [[bedtime story]]. He explained in 1985 \"When I was 11 years old I actually directed the story during a school production. I have always felt like Peter Pan. I still feel like Peter Pan. It has been very hard for me to grow up, I'm a victim of the [[Puer aeternus#Peter Pan syndrome|Peter Pan syndrome]].\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=42\u20133}}\n\nIn the early 1980s, Spielberg began to develop a film with [[Walt Disney Pictures]] that would have closely followed the storyline of the [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|1924 silent film]] and [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 animated film]].<ref name=beetle>{{cite interview|interviewer=Ana Maria Bahiana|subject=Steven Spielberg|url=https://issuu.com/libuow/docs/cinemapaper1992marno087|publication-date=March\u2013April 1992|title=Hook: Steven Spielberg|issue=87|magazine=[[Cinema Papers]]|pp=12\u201316|via=[[issuu]]}}</ref> He also considered directing it as a musical with [[Michael Jackson]] in the lead.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=409}} Jackson expressed interest in the part, but was not interested in Spielberg's vision of an adult Peter Pan who had forgotten about his past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/12/04/michael_jackson_was_steven_spielbergs_|title=Michael Jackson Was Steven Spielberg's First Choice To Play Peter Pan In 'Hook'|website=Starpulse.com|accessdate=March 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208143650/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/12/04/michael_jackson_was_steven_spielbergs_|archive-date=February 8, 2012}}</ref> The project was taken to [[Paramount Pictures]], where [[James V.

Elliot Scott had been hired as [[production designer]].<ref name=beetle/> With the birth of his first son, Max, in 1985, Spielberg decided to drop out. \"I decided not to make ''Peter Pan'' when I had my first child,\" Spielberg commented. \"I didn't want to go to [[London]] and have seven kids on wires in front of [[chroma key|blue screens]]. I wanted to be home as a dad.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=409}} Around this time, he considered directing ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', which carried similar motifs and themes with it.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=409}} In 1987, he \"permanently abandoned\" it, feeling he expressed his childhood and adult themes in ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Forsberg |first=Myra |date=January 10, 1988 |title=Spielberg at 40: The Man and the Child |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/spielberg-turns40.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York, NY |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount and Hart moved forward on production with [[Nick Castle]] as director. Hart began to work on a new storyline when his son, Jake, showed his family a drawing. \"We asked Jake what it was and he said it was a crocodile eating Captain Hook, but that the crocodile really didn't eat him, he got away,\" Hart reflected. \"As it happens, I had been trying to crack ''Peter Pan'' for years, but I didn't just want to do a remake. So I went, 'Wow. Hook is not dead. The crocodile is. We've all been fooled'. In 1986 our family was having dinner and Jake said, 'Daddy, did Peter Pan ever grow up?' My immediate response was, 'No, of course not'. And Jake said, 'But what if he did?' I realized that Peter did grow up, just like all of us [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boomers]] who are now in our forties. I patterned him after several of my friends on [[Wall Street]], where the pirates wear three-piece suits and ride in [[Limousine|limos]].\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=410}}\n\n===Filming===\nBy 1989, Ian Rathbone changed the title to ''Hook'', and took it from Paramount to [[TriStar Pictures]], headed by [[Mike Medavoy]], who was Spielberg's first [[talent agent]]. [[Robin Williams]] signed on, but he and Hoffman had creative differences with Castle. Medavoy saw the film as a vehicle for Spielberg and Castle was dismissed, but paid a $500,000 settlement.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=410}} [[Dodi Fayed]], who owned certain rights to make a ''Peter Pan'' film, sold his interest to TriStar in exchange for an [[executive producer]] credit.{{sfn|Medavoy|Young|2002|p=230}} Spielberg briefly worked together with Hart to rewrite the script<ref name=beetle/> before hiring [[Malia Scotch Marmo]] to rewrite Captain Hook's dialog and [[Carrie Fisher]] for [[Tinker Bell]]'s. The [[Writers Guild of America]] gave Hart and Marmo screenplay credit, while Hart and Castle were credited with the story. Fisher went uncredited. Filming began on February 19, 1991, occupying nine [[sound stage]]s at [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=411}} Stage 30 housed the [[Neverland]] [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]] [[playground]], while Stage 10 supplied Captain Hook's [[Cabin (ship)|ship cabin]]. Hidden [[hydraulics]] were installed to rock the set-piece to simulate a swaying ship, but the filmmakers found the movement distracted the dialogue, so the idea was dropped.<ref name=DVD/>\n\nStage 27 housed the full-sized ''Jolly Roger'' and the surrounding Pirate [[Wharf]].<ref name=DVD>DVD production notes</ref> [[Industrial Light & Magic]] provided the [[visual effects]] sequences. This marked the beginning of [[Tony Swatton]]'s career, as he was asked to make weaponry for the film. It was financed by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and TriStar Pictures, with TriStar distributing it. Spielberg brought on [[John Napier (designer)|John Napier]] as a \"visual consultant\", having been impressed with his work on ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''. The original production budget was set at $48 million, but ended up between $60\u201380 million.{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=410, 412}} The primary reason for the increased budget was the [[shooting schedule]], which ran 40 days over its original 76-day schedule. Spielberg explained, \"It was all my fault. I began to work at a slower pace than I usually do.\"\n\nSpielberg's on-set relationship with [[Julia Roberts]] was troubled, and he later admitted in an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', \"It was an unfortunate time for us to work together.\" In a 1999 [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] interview, Roberts said that Spielberg's comments \"really hurt my feelings.\" She \"couldn't believe this person that I knew and trusted was actually hesitating to come to my defense...it was the first time that I felt I had a turncoat in my midst.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/15-hollywood-set-feuds |title=15 On-Set Beefs That Will Go Down in Hollywood History |last=Desta |first=Yohana |date=August 19, 2016 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |publisher= |access-date=March 27, 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2014}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Hook (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[John Williams]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|1991|11|26}} ''(original)''<br>{{start date|2012|03|27}} ''(reissue)''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jwfan.com/?p=2580 |title=HOOK 2CD Set Includes \u2018Over 65 minutes of Music Previously Unreleased\u2019 |last= |first= |date=May 20, 2012 |work=JOHN WILLIAMS Fan Network |publisher= |access-date=May 21, 2012 |quote=}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 75:18 ''(original)''<br> 140:34 ''(reissue)''\n| label      = [[Epic Records]] ''(original)''<br>La-La Land Records ''(reissue)''\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = [[Home Alone (soundtrack)|Home Alone]]\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[JFK (soundtrack)|JFK]]\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe [[film score]] was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]].

Hart]] and [[Malia Scotch Marmo]]. It stars [[Robin Williams]] as [[Peter Pan|Peter Banning / Peter Pan]], [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Captain Hook]], [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Tinker Bell]], [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mr. Smee]] and [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Wendy Darling|Granny Wendy]]. It acts as a [[sequel]] to [[J. M. Barrie]]'s  1911 novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''  focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood. In his new life, he is known as Peter Banning, a successful but unimaginative and workaholic accountant with a wife (Wendy's granddaughter) and two children. However, when Captain Hook, the enemy of his past, kidnaps his children, he returns to [[Neverland]] to save them. Along the journey, he reclaims the memories of his past and becomes a better person.\n\nSpielberg began developing the film in the early 1980s with [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], which would have followed the storyline seen in the 1924 [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|silent film]] and 1953 [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|animated Disney film]]. It entered [[pre-production]] in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. [[James V. Hart]] developed the script with director [[Nick Castle]] and [[TriStar Pictures]] before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. It was shot almost entirely on [[sound stage]]s at [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]]. \n\nReleased on December 11, 1991, ''Hook'' received mixed reviews from critics, and while it was a commercial success, its box office take was lower than expected. Spielberg himself later admitted that he was disappointed with the final film. It has gained a strong cult following since its release.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roshanian|first=Arya|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/hook-cast-reunion-robin-williams-film-turns-25-anniversary-lost-boys-1201834867/|title=\u2018Hook\u2019 Reunion: Lost Boys Remember Robin Williams as Film Turns 25|work=Variety|date=August 10, 2016}}</ref> It was nominated in five categories at the [[64th Academy Awards]]. It also spawned merchandise, including [[#Video games|video games]], [[action figures]], and comic book adaptations.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Corporate lawyer]] Peter Banning is unaware his [[workaholic]] lifestyle in [[San Francisco]] is straining his relationship with his wife Moira and their children Jack and Maggie. As the family prepare to fly to London to visit Moria's grandmother [[Wendy Darling]], Peter focuses on completing his work before leaving, inadvertently missing Jack's baseball game. In London, Peter berates his children while conducting more work, causing Moira to argue with him and throw out his cell phone. That evening, Peter, Moira and Wendy attend a charity dinner in Wendy's honor, leaving her old friend [[Tootles]] and her housekeeper Liza watching over the children. When the group return, they find the house ransacked and the children missing, with a ransom note left behind supposedly written by [[Captain Hook|Captain James Hook]]. Although Peter involves the authorities in the matter, Wendy stipulates they cannot help, and that the note's writer is real, claiming Peter is really [[Peter Pan]].\n\nPeter refuses to believe this, but is surprised when drinking in the nursery to encounter [[Tinker Bell]], who uses her pixie dust to bring him to [[Neverland]]. Tinker Bell drops Peter within the ranks of Hook's pirates, whereupon he attempts to rescue his children after seeing Hook displaying them to his crew. Surprised to see Peter, Hook challenges him to fly and rescue his children, but upon seeing he cannot, prepares to execute him. Tinker Bell persuades Hook to let him go instead, promising to bring him back when he has his skills for a climactic battle in three days, vowing that if he wins, Hook will return his children to him. Peter finds himself taken to the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]], who have been led by Rufio following Pan's absence. Although they initially scoff at the idea that he is Peter Pan, Tinker Bell helps him prove himself by making him use his imagination to restore some of his abilities, although Rufio remains unimpressed.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Mr. Smee]] suggests to Hook to try to turn Peter's children against him. Although this tactic does not work with Maggie, Jack is swayed due to his father's failure to attend his games. Hook then has the pirates play a game of baseball, which Peter spies on while trying to steal his hook. Horrified to see Hook convert Jack to follow him, Peter forces himself to remember who he is, and finds himself brought back to the treehouse by Tinker Bell, where Wendy and her brothers stayed in alongside Pan and the Lost Boys. Once there, Peter begins recalling his lost memories, remembering how he came to Neverland as an infant, thanks to Tinker Bell, and his adventures with the Darling children. He finally recalls that he frequently returned to see Wendy, after the Darlings returned to London, until she had grown old, whereupon he stayed behind after falling in love with her daughter Moira.\n\nRecalling the day of Jack's birth, Peter finds a strong happy thought that restores his power to fly, and bringing him back as Peter Pan. Shocked that he is, Rufio turns over his sword to him, whereupon Pan and the Lost Boys arrive to fight Hook and his pirates as promised. As Peter fights his old nemesis, Jack realizes what Hook has been doing and returns to supporting his father. While Peter focuses on rescuing Maggie, Rufio engages Hook in a sword fight but is fatally stabbed. Angered by Hook's vows to continue coming after Peter's children, Peter engages him in a one-on-one sword fight, whereupon he defeats him and leaves him to be devoured by the the taxidermied [[crocodile]], after it briefly reanimates and collapses on him. While asking Tinker Bell to take his children home, Peter reveals he is too old to stay, and appoints his successor amongst the Lost Boys before returning to London.\n\nPeter awakens in [[Kensington Gardens]] with the belief he was dreaming, but is surprised to see Mr. Smee cleaning up bottles nearby. Seeing Tinker Bell waiting nearby, Peter tearfully bids her farewell before returning to Wendy's house. Reuniting with his family, Peter decides to change his life, and abandons his job in order to devote more time to his family. Realizing he was given something before leaving, Peter hands over to Tootles his lost bag of marbles, whereupon he joyfully shakes it in delight and gets sprinkled in pixie dust. As the family watch him flying out of the house, Peter admits to Wendy that his adventures are not yet over as he hugs his family and they watch Tootles begin his flight to Neverland.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast: top 10 per tombstone closing credits order, remaining order and credited roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{see also|Characters of Peter Pan}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Peter Pan|Peter Banning / Peter Pan]]\n** Ryan Francis as teenage Peter Pan\n** Max Hoffman as young Peter Pan\n** Matthew Van Ginkel as baby Peter Pan\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Captain James Hook]]\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Tinker Bell]]\n** [[Lisa Wilhoit]] as Tinker Bell in a flashback in which Peter is a baby\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mr. Smee|Smee]]/Sweeper in Kensington Gardens\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Wendy Darling|Granny Wendy]]\n** [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as teenage Wendy Darling\n* [[Charlie Korsmo]] as Jack\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Moira\n* [[Dante Basco]] as Rufio\n* Amber Scott as Maggie\n* [[Jasen Fisher]] as Ace\n* [[Laurel Cronin]] as Liza, Granny Wendy's maid\n* [[Phil Collins]] as Inspector Good\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as Tootles\n* Isaiah Robinson as Pockets\n* Raushan Hammond as Thud Butt\n* [[James Madio]] as Don't Ask\n* Thomas Tulak as Too Small\n* Alex Zuckerman as Latchboy\n* Ahmad Stoner as No Nap\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn addition, a number of celebrities and family members made brief credited and uncredited cameos in the film:<ref name=Cameos>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/the-boy-who-inspired-hook-and-19-more-facts-as-film-turns-25-photos/ |title=The Boy Who Inspired \u2018Hook\u2019 and 19 Other Little-Known Facts as Film Turns 25 (Photos) |last=Doty |first=Meriah |date=December 11, 2016 |website=[[TheWrap]] |publisher= |access-date=October 12, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> musicians [[David Crosby]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]], as well as [[Academy Awards|Oscar-nominated]] actress [[Glenn Close]] and former [[NFL]] player [[Tony Burton]], appear as members of Hook's pirate crew; two major ''[[Star Wars]]'' associates, [[George Lucas]] and [[Carrie Fisher]], play the kissing couple sprinkled with [[pixie dust]]; two of Hoffman's children, [[Jake Hoffman|Jacob]] and Rebecca, both under 10-years-old during filming, briefly appeared in scenes in the \"normal\" world; screenwriter Jim Hart's 11-year-old son Jake, who years earlier inspired his father with the question \"What if Peter Pan grew up?\", plays one of Pan's Lost Boys.\n\n==Production==\n===Inspiration===\nSpielberg found a close personal connection to Peter Pan's story from his own childhood. The troubled relationship between Peter and Jack in the sequel echoed Spielberg's relationship with his own father. Previous Spielberg films that explored a dysfunctional father-son relationship included ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Peter's \"quest for success\" paralleled Spielberg starting out as a [[film director]] and transforming into a Hollywood [[business magnate]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=413}} \"I think a lot of people today are losing their imagination because they are work-driven. They are so self-involved with work and success and arriving at the next plateau that children and family almost become incidental. I have even experienced it myself when I have been on a very tough shoot and I've not seen my kids except on weekends. They ask for my time and I can't give it to them because I'm working.\"<ref name=beetle/> Like Peter at the beginning of the film, Spielberg has a [[fear of flying]]. He feels that Peter's \"enduring quality\" in the storyline is simply to fly. \"Anytime anything flies, whether it's [[Superman]], [[Batman]], or E.T., it's got to be a tip of the hat to Peter Pan,\" Spielberg reflected in a 1992 interview. \"''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' was the first time I saw anybody fly. Before I saw Superman, before I saw Batman, and of course before I saw any [[superhero]]es, my first memory of anybody flying is in ''Peter Pan''.\"<ref name=beetle/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe genesis of the film started when Spielberg's mother often read him ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' as a [[bedtime story]]. He explained in 1985 \"When I was 11 years old I actually directed the story during a school production. I have always felt like Peter Pan. I still feel like Peter Pan. It has been very hard for me to grow up, I'm a victim of the [[Puer aeternus#Peter Pan syndrome|Peter Pan syndrome]].\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=42\u20133}}\n\nIn the early 1980s, Spielberg began to develop a film with [[Walt Disney Pictures]] that would have closely followed the storyline of the [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|1924 silent film]] and [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 animated film]].<ref name=beetle>{{cite interview|interviewer=Ana Maria Bahiana|subject=Steven Spielberg|url=https://issuu.com/libuow/docs/cinemapaper1992marno087|publication-date=March\u2013April 1992|title=Hook: Steven Spielberg|issue=87|magazine=[[Cinema Papers]]|pp=12\u201316|via=[[issuu]]}}</ref> He also considered directing it as a musical with [[Michael Jackson]] in the lead.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=409}} Jackson expressed interest in the part, but was not interested in Spielberg's vision of an adult Peter Pan who had forgotten about his past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/12/04/michael_jackson_was_steven_spielbergs_|title=Michael Jackson Was Steven Spielberg's First Choice To Play Peter Pan In 'Hook'|website=Starpulse.com|accessdate=March 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208143650/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/12/04/michael_jackson_was_steven_spielbergs_|archive-date=February 8, 2012}}</ref> The project was taken to [[Paramount Pictures]], where [[James V.

Elliot Scott had been hired as [[production designer]].<ref name=beetle/> With the birth of his first son, Max, in 1985, Spielberg decided to drop out. \"I decided not to make ''Peter Pan'' when I had my first child,\" Spielberg commented. \"I didn't want to go to [[London]] and have seven kids on wires in front of [[chroma key|blue screens]]. I wanted to be home as a dad.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=409}} Around this time, he considered directing ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', which carried similar motifs and themes with it.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=409}} In 1987, he \"permanently abandoned\" it, feeling he expressed his childhood and adult themes in ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Forsberg |first=Myra |date=January 10, 1988 |title=Spielberg at 40: The Man and the Child |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/spielberg-turns40.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York, NY |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount and Hart moved forward on production with [[Nick Castle]] as director. Hart began to work on a new storyline when his son, Jake, showed his family a drawing. \"We asked Jake what it was and he said it was a crocodile eating Captain Hook, but that the crocodile really didn't eat him, he got away,\" Hart reflected. \"As it happens, I had been trying to crack ''Peter Pan'' for years, but I didn't just want to do a remake. So I went, 'Wow. Hook is not dead. The crocodile is. We've all been fooled'. In 1986 our family was having dinner and Jake said, 'Daddy, did Peter Pan ever grow up?' My immediate response was, 'No, of course not'. And Jake said, 'But what if he did?' I realized that Peter did grow up, just like all of us [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boomers]] who are now in our forties. I patterned him after several of my friends on [[Wall Street]], where the pirates wear three-piece suits and ride in [[Limousine|limos]].\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=410}}\n\n===Filming===\nBy 1989, Ian Rathbone changed the title to ''Hook'', and took it from Paramount to [[TriStar Pictures]], headed by [[Mike Medavoy]], who was Spielberg's first [[talent agent]]. [[Robin Williams]] signed on, but he and Hoffman had creative differences with Castle.

When Avalokiteshvara saw this, tears sprang to his eyes. A teardrop from his right eye fell to the plain and became the reverend [[Bhrikuti]], who declared: \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavour!\" Bhrikuti was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's right eye, and was reborn in a later life as the Nepalese princess Tritsun. A teardrop from his left eye fell upon the plain and became the reverend Tara. She also declared, \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavor!\" T\u0101r\u0101 was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's left eye.\"\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 manifests in many different forms. In Tibet, these forms included Green T\u0101r\u0101's manifestation as the Nepalese Princess ([[Bhrikuti]]),<ref>((Min Bahadur Shakya |title=The Life and Contribution of the Nepalese Princess Bhrikuti Devi to Tibetan History |year=2009 |publisher=Pilgrims Publishing})</ref> and White T\u0101r\u0101's manifestation as the Chinese princess Kongjo ([[Princess Wencheng]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Sakyapa Sonam Gyaltsen |title=The Clear Mirror: A Traditional Account of Tibet's Golden Age |year=1996 |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |pages=64\u201365 |isbn=1-55939-048-4 }}</ref>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 is also known as a [[salvation|saviouress]], as a heavenly deity who hears the cries of beings experiencing misery in [[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]].\n\nWhether the T\u0101r\u0101 figure originated as a Buddhist or Hindu goddess is unclear and remains a source of inquiry among scholars.

As one of the three deities of long life, White Tara (''Saraswati'') is associated with longevity. White Tara counteracts illness and thereby helps to bring about a long life.

Her name is Jnanachanrda or Yeshe Dawa, which means \"Moon of [[:wikt:primordial|Primordial]] Awareness\". For quite a number of [[aeon]]s she makes offerings to the Buddha of that world system, whose name was Tonyo Drupa. She receives special instruction from him concerning [[bodhicitta]] - the infinitely compassionate mental state of a bodhisattva. After doing this, some monks approach her and suggest that because of her level of attainment she should next pray to be reborn as a male to progress further. At this point she lets the monks know in no uncertain terms that it is only \"weak minded worldlings\" who see gender as a barrier to attaining [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. She sadly notes there have been few who wish to work for the welfare of sentient beings in a female form, though. Therefore, she resolves to always be reborn as a female bodhisattva, until [[samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]] is no more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/samhita-arni-points-out-how-caste-and-gender-prejudice-are-inextricably-linked/article17433634.ece|title=Gender doesn\u2019t come in the way of Nirvana|last=Arni|first=Samhita|date=2017-03-09|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-12-14|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> She then stays in a palace in a state of [[meditation]] for some ten million years, and the power of this practice releases tens of millions of beings from suffering. As a result of this, Tonyo Drupa tells her she will henceforth manifest supreme [[bodhi]] as the Goddess T\u0101r\u0101 in many world systems to come.\n\nWith this story in mind, it is interesting to juxtapose this with a quotation from the [[14th Dalai Lama]] about T\u0101r\u0101, spoken at a conference on Compassionate Action in Newport Beach, CA in 1989:\n\n<blockquote>There is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess T\u0101r\u0101. Following her cultivation of [[bodhicitta]], the bodhisattva's motivation, she looked upon the situation of those striving towards full awakening and she felt that there were too few people who attained [[Buddhahood]] as women. So she vowed, \"I have developed bodhicitta as a woman. For all my lifetimes along the path I vow to be born as a woman, and in my final lifetime when I attain Buddhahood, then, too, I will be a woman.\"</blockquote>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101, then, embodies certain ideals which make her attractive to women practitioners, and her emergence as a Bodhisattva can be seen as a part of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism's reaching out to women, and becoming more inclusive even in 6th-century CE [[India]].\n\n==Symbols and associations==\n[[File:Green tara 1947 wk.jpg|upright|thumb|Painting of Buddhist goddess Green Tara by Prithvi Man Chitrakari done in 1947.]]\nT\u0101r\u0101's name literally means \"star\" or \"planet\", and therefore she is associated with navigation and travel both literally and metaphorically as spiritual crossing to the 'other side' of the ocean of existence (enlightenment).<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 310</ref> Hence she is known literally as \"she who saves\" in Tibetan.<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref> In the ''108 Names of the Holy Tara'', Tara is 'Leader of the caravans ..... who showeth the way to those who have lost it' and she is named as ''Dhruva'', the Sanskrit name for the [[North Star]].<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref>\n\nAccording to Miranda Shaw, \"[[Motherhood]] is central to the conception of Tara\".<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316</ref> Her titles include \"loving mother\", \"supreme mother\", \"mother of the world\",  \"universal mother\" and \"mother of all Buddhas\".<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316-317</ref>\n\nShe is most often shown with the blue lotus or night lotus (''utpala''), which releases its fragrance with the appearance of the moon and therefore T\u0101r\u0101 is also associated with the moon and night.<ref>Beer, Robert; The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols, page 170</ref><ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref> \n\nT\u0101r\u0101 is also a forest goddess, particularly in her form as ''Khadiravani'', \"dweller in the Khadira forest\" and is generally associated with plant life, flowers, acacia (khadira) trees and the wind. Because of her association with nature and plants, T\u0101r\u0101 is also known as a healing goddess (especially as White T\u0101r\u0101) and as a goddess of nurturing quality and fertility.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 324</ref> Her pure land in Mount Potala is described as \"Covered with manifold trees and creepers, resounding with the sound of many birds, And with murmur of waterfalls, thronged with wild beasts of many kinds; Many species of flowers grow everywhere.\"<ref>Edward Conze, Buddhist Texts Through the Ages, p.196.</ref> Her association with the wind element (vaayu) also means that she is swift in responding to calls for any aid.\n\n==T\u0101r\u0101 as a saviouress==\n[[File:GreenTara150.jpg|upright|thumb|Green Tara, [[Nepal]], 14th century.

Bell Fund, 1966, 66.179.]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 also embodies many of the qualities of feminine principle. She is known as the Mother of Mercy and Compassion. She is the source, the female aspect of the universe, which gives birth to warmth, compassion and relief from bad karma as experienced by ordinary beings in cyclic existence. She engenders, nourishes, smiles at the vitality of creation, and has sympathy for all beings as a mother does for her children. As Green T\u0101r\u0101 she offers succor and protection from all the unfortunate circumstances one can encounter within the samsaric world. As White T\u0101r\u0101 she expresses maternal compassion and offers healing to beings who are hurt or wounded, either mentally or psychically. As Red T\u0101r\u0101 she teaches discriminating awareness about created phenomena, and how to turn raw desire into compassion and love. As Blue T\u0101r\u0101 ([[Ekajati]]) she becomes a protector in the [[Nyingma]] lineage, who expresses a ferocious, wrathful, female energy whose invocation destroys all Dharmic obstacles and engenders good luck and swift spiritual awakening.<ref name=\"beyer\"/>\n\nWithin [[Tibetan Buddhism]], she has 21 major forms in all, each tied to a certain color and energy. And each offers some feminine attribute, of ultimate benefit to the spiritual aspirant who asks for her assistance.\n\nAnother quality of feminine principle which she shares with the [[dakini]]s is playfulness. As [[John Blofeld]] expands upon in ''Bodhisattva of Compassion'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=Bodhisattva of Compassion: The Mystical Tradition of Kuan Yin |year=2009 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |quote= |url=https://archive.org/details/bodhisattvaofcom00john |isbn=1-59030-735-6 |url-access=registration }}</ref> T\u0101r\u0101 is frequently depicted as a young sixteen-year-old girlish woman. She often manifests in the lives of [[dharma]] practitioners when they take themselves, or the spiritual path too seriously. There are Tibetan tales in which she laughs at self-righteousness, or plays pranks on those who lack reverence for the feminine. In ''Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Thinley Norbu |title=Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis |year=1999 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |isbn=0-87773-885-8 }}</ref> Thinley Norbu explores this as \"Playmind\". Applied to T\u0101r\u0101 one could say that her playful mind can relieve ordinary minds which become rigidly serious or tightly gripped by dualistic distinctions. She takes delight in an open mind and a receptive heart then. For in this openness and receptivity her blessings can naturally unfold and her energies can quicken the aspirants spiritual development.\n\nThese qualities of feminine principle then, found an expression in Indian [[Mahayana]] Buddhism and the emerging [[Vajrayana]] of Tibet, as the many forms of T\u0101r\u0101, as dakinis, as [[Prajnaparamita]], and as many other local and specialized feminine divinities. As the worship of T\u0101r\u0101 developed, various prayers, chants and mantras became associated with her. These came out of a felt devotional need, and from her inspiration causing spiritual masters to compose and set down [[sadhana]]s, or tantric meditation practices. Two ways of approach to her began to emerge. In one common folk and lay practitioners would simply directly appeal to her to ease some of the travails of worldly life. In the second, she became a [[Tantra|Tantric]] deity whose practice would be used by monks or tantric yogis in order to develop her qualities in themselves, ultimately leading through her to the source of her qualities, which are [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]], Enlightened Compassion, and Enlightened Mind.\n\n==T\u0101r\u0101 as a Tantric deity==\n[[File:Tara thangka.jpg|thumb|right|18th-century Eastern [[Tibet]]an [[thanka]], with the Green Tara (Samaya Tara Yogini) in the center and the Blue, Red, White and Yellow taras in the corners, [[Rubin Museum of Art]]]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 as a focus for tantric deity [[yoga]] can be traced back to the time period of [[Padmasambhava]]. There is a Red T\u0101r\u0101 practice which was given by Padmasambhava to [[Yeshe Tsogyal]]. He asked that she [[terton|hide it as a treasure]]. It was not until the 20th century, that a great Nyingma lama, Apong Terton rediscovered it. It is said that this lama was reborn as [[Sakya Trizin]], present head of the [[Sakyapa]] sect. A monk who had known Apong Terton succeeded in retransmitting it to Sakya Trizin, and the same monk also gave it to [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], who released it to his western students.\n\nMartin Willson in ''In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101'' traces many different lineages of T\u0101r\u0101 Tantras, that is T\u0101r\u0101 scriptures used as Tantric sadhanas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin Willson |title=In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101: Songs to the Saviouress |year=1992 |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |quote= | pages=| url= |isbn=0-86171-109-2 }}</ref> For example, a T\u0101r\u0101 sadhana was revealed to [[Tilopa]] (988\u20131069 CE), the human father of the [[Karma Kagyu]]. [[Atisa]], the great translator and founder of the [[Kadampa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, was a devotee of T\u0101r\u0101. He composed a praise to her, and three T\u0101r\u0101 Sadhanas. Martin Willson's work also contains charts which show origins of her tantras in various lineages, but suffice to say that T\u0101r\u0101 as a tantric practice quickly spread from around the 7th century CE onwards, and remains an important part of Vajrayana Buddhism to this day.\n\nThe practices themselves usually present T\u0101r\u0101 as a tutelary deity (thug dam, [[yidam]]) which the practitioners sees as being a latent aspect of one's mind, or a manifestation in a visible form of a quality stemming from [[Jnana|Buddha Jnana]]. As John Blofeld puts it in ''The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet'':\n\n{{quote|The function of the Yidam is one of the profound mysteries of the Vajrayana...Especially during the first years of practice the Yidam is of immense importance. Yidam is the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit word \"I\u1e63\u1e6dadeva\"\u2014the in-dwelling deity; but, where the Hindus take the I\u1e63\u1e6dadeva for an actual deity who has been invited to dwell in the devotee's heart, the Yidams of Tantric Buddhism are in fact the emanations of the adepts own mind. Or are they? To some extent they seem to belong to that order of phenomena which in Jungian terms are called archetypes and are therefore the common property of the entire human race. Even among Tantric Buddhists, there may be a division of opinion as to how far the Yidams are the creations of individual minds. What is quite certain is that they are not independently existing gods and goddesses; and yet, paradoxically, there are many occasions when they must be so regarded.''<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet: A Practical Guide to the Theory, Purpose, and Techniques of Tantric Meditation |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |page=176 |isbn=0-14-019336-7 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:Kurukulla (Red Tara) - AMNH - DSC06232.JPG|thumb|[[Kurukulla]] thangka, American Museum of Natural History, Manhattan, New York City]]\n[[File:Sarasvati thangka.jpg|thumb|[[Sarasvati]] thangka, Eastern Tibet, 18th century]]\nThere are many forms of T\u0101r\u0101, including various popular lists of 21 different emanations of T\u0101r\u0101. Green T\u0101r\u0101, (\u015by\u0101mat\u0101r\u0101) associated with peacefulness and enlightened activity is the most depicted and the central aspect of T\u0101r\u0101 from which others such as the 21 T\u0101r\u0101s emanate. In her Green form, she is often also known as Khadirava\u1e47i-T\u0101r\u0101 (T\u0101r\u0101 of the acacia forest), who appeared to [[Nagarjuna]] in the Khadiravani forest of [[South India]] and protects from the eight great fears. She is often accompanied by her two attendants M\u0101r\u012bc\u012b and Ekaja\u1e6d\u0101. Dharmachari Purna writes on the various forms of Tara:\n\n<blockquote>T\u0101r\u0101 is in fact the name of a whole class of deities. She appears in all the five colours of the Jinas. There are at least ten green forms, seven white, five yellow, two blue and one red. As Sarvaj\u00f1amitra says of her form: 'It is a universal form, varied like crystal, since it changes according to circumstance'.She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her figure is shown in virtually all postures from standing to sitting, full lotus, half lotus, one leg down, and both legs down. There is apparently also a reclining T\u0101r\u0101. She has two-armed forms, four arms, eight arms, twelve arms, and Getty even mentions a Tibetan painting showing a standing T\u0101r\u0101 with 'one thousand heads and arms'. Ghosh lists seventy-six distinct forms of T\u0101r\u0101, and tradition tells us there are one hundred and eight names for her.<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Sarvajnamitra she has a \u201cuniversal form\u201d (''visva-rupa''), that encompasses all living beings and deities, and which changes with the needs of each being.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 337</ref>\n\nOther forms of T\u0101r\u0101 include:\n\n*White T\u0101r\u0101, (Sitat\u0101r\u0101) with two arms seated on a white lotus and with eyes on her hand and feet, as well as a third eye on her forehead (thus she is also known as \"Seven eyed\").

Most all of them include some introductory praises or homages to invoke her presence and prayers of taking refuge. Then her [[mantra]] is recited, followed by a visualization of her, perhaps more mantra, then the visualization is dissolved, followed by a dedication of the merit from doing the practice. Additionally there may be extra prayers of aspirations, and a long life prayer for the Lama who originated the practice. Many of the T\u0101r\u0101 sadhanas are seen as beginning practices within the world of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], however what is taking place during the visualization of the deity actually invokes some of the most sublime teachings of all Buddhism. Two examples are Zabtik Drolchok<ref>http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Zabtik_Drolchok</ref> and Chime Pakme Nyingtik.<ref>http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chim%C3%A9_Phakm%C3%A9_Nyingtik</ref>\n\nIn this case during the creation phase of T\u0101r\u0101 as a yidam, she is seen as having as much reality as any other phenomena apprehended through the mind. By reciting her mantra and visualizing her form in front, or on the head of the adept, one is opening to her energies of compassion and wisdom. After a period of time the practitioner shares in some of these qualities, becomes imbued with her being and all it represents. At the same time all of this is seen as coming out of Emptiness and having a translucent quality like a rainbow. Then many times there is a visualization of oneself as T\u0101r\u0101. One simultaneously becomes inseparable from all her good qualities while at the same time realizing the emptiness of the visualization of oneself as the [[yidam]] and also the emptiness of one's ordinary self.\n\nThis occurs in the completion stage of the practice. One dissolves the created deity form and at the same time also realizes how much of what we call the \"self\" is a creation of the mind, and has no long term substantial inherent existence. This part of the practice then is preparing the practitioner to be able to confront the dissolution of one's self at death and ultimately be able to approach through various stages of meditation upon emptiness, the realization of Ultimate Truth as a vast display of [[Emptiness]] and Luminosity. At the same time the recitation of the mantra has been invoking T\u0101r\u0101's energy through its [[Sanskrit]] [[seed syllable]]s and this purifies and activates certain psychic centers of the body ([[chakras]]). This also untangles knots of psychic energy which have hindered the practitioner from developing a Vajra body, which is necessary to be able to progress to more advanced practices and deeper stages of realization.\n\nTherefore, even in a simple T\u0101r\u0101 [[sadhana]] a plethora of outer, inner, and secret events is taking place and there are now many works such as ''Deity Yoga'', compiled by the present Dalai Lama,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] |title=Deity Yoga: In Action and Performance Tantra |year=1987 |publisher=[[Snow Lion Publications]] |quote= | url= |isbn=0-937938-50-5 }}</ref> which explores all the ramifications of working with a [[yidam]] in Tantric practices.\n\nThe end results of doing such T\u0101r\u0101 practices are many. For one thing it reduces the forces of delusion in the forms of negative karma, sickness, afflictions of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]], and other obstacles and obscurations.\n\nThe mantra helps generate Bodhicitta within the heart of the practitioner and purifies the psychic channels ([[nadis]]) within the body allowing a more natural expression of generosity and compassion to flow from the heart center. Through experiencing T\u0101r\u0101's perfected form one acknowledges one's own perfected form, that is one's intrinsic Buddha nature, which is usually covered over by obscurations and clinging to dualistic [[phenomena]] as being inherently real and permanent.\n\nThe practice then weans one away from a coarse understanding of Reality, allowing one to get in touch with inner qualities similar to those of a bodhisattva, and prepares one's inner self to embrace finer spiritual energies, which can lead to more subtle and profound realizations of the Emptiness of phenomena and self.\n\nAs [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], in his ''Introduction to the Red T\u0101r\u0101 Sadhana'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] |title=Red Tara Commentary: Instructions for the Concise Practice Known as Red Tara\u2014An Open Door to Bliss |year=1998 |publisher=Padma Publishing |quote= | url= |isbn=1-881847-04-7 }}</ref> notes of his lineage: \"T\u0101r\u0101 is the flawless expression of the inseparability of emptiness, awareness and compassion. Just as you use a mirror to see your face, T\u0101r\u0101 [[meditation]] is a means of seeing the true face of your mind, devoid of any trace of delusion\".\n\nThere are several preparations to be done before practising the Sadhana. To perform a correct execution the practitioner must be prepared and take on the proper disposition. The preparations may be grouped as \"internal\" and \"external\". Both are necessary to achieve the required concentration.\n\n<blockquote>The preparations are of two types: external and internal. The external preparations consist of cleaning the meditation room, setting up a shrine with images of Buddha Shakyamuni and Green Tara, and setting out a beautiful arrangement of offerings.  We can use water to represent nectar for drinking, water for bathing the feet, and perfume. For the remaining offerings\u2014flowers, incense, light, and pure food\u2014if possible we should set out the actual substances. As for internal preparations, we should try to improve our compassion, bodhichitta, and correct view of emptiness through the practice of the stages of the path, and to receive a Tantric empowerment of Green Tara. It is possible to participate in group pujas if we have not yet received an empowerment, but to gain deep experience of this practice we need to receive an empowerment. The main internal preparation is to generate and strengthen our faith in Arya Tara, regarding her as the synthesis of all Gurus, Yidams, and Buddhas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905093605/http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-05 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tara statue near Kulu.jpg|Tara statue near [[Kullu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], India.\nFile:Ratnagiri ei3-40.jpg|Medititating Tara, [[Ratnagiri, Odisha]], India, 8th century\nFile:White Tara statue manor place 291107.jpg|White Tara statue in a [[Karma Kagyu]] [[dharma centre]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Terma teachings related to T\u0101r\u0101==\n[[Terma (Buddhism)|Terma]] teachings are \"hidden teachings\" said to have been left by [[Padmasambhava]] (8th century) and others for the benefit of future generations.

She appears as a female [[bodhisattva]] in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, and as a female [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. She is known as the \"mother of liberation\", and represents the virtues of success in work and achievements. She is known as ''Tara Bosatsu'' (\u591a\u7f85\u83e9\u85a9) in [[Japan]], and occasionally as ''Du\u014dlu\u00f3 P\u00fas\u00e0'' (\u591a\u7f85\u83e9\u85a9) in [[Chinese Buddhism]].<ref>[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/b_fbodi.htm Buddhist Deities: Bodhisattvas of Compassion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 is a [[yidam|meditation deity]] worshiped by practitioners of the Tibetan branch of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism to develop certain inner qualities and to understand outer, inner and secret teachings such as [[karu\u1e47\u0101]] (compassion), [[mett\u0101]] (loving-kindness), and [[shunyata]] (emptiness). T\u0101r\u0101 may more properly be understood as different aspects of the same quality, as bodhisattvas are often considered [[personification]]s of Buddhist [[method]]s.\n\nThere is also recognition in some schools of [[Buddhism]] of ''twenty-one T\u0101r\u0101s''. A practice text entitled ''[[Praises to the Twenty-One Taras]]'', is the most important text on Tara in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Another key text is the ''Tantra Which is the Source for All the Functions of Tara, Mother of All the Tathagatas''.<ref>Beyer, Stephan; The Cult of Tara Magic and Ritual, page 13.</ref> \n\nThe main T\u0101r\u0101 [[mantra]] is the same for Buddhists and Hindus alike: {{IAST|o\u1e43 t\u0101re tutt\u0101re ture sv\u0101h\u0101}}. It is pronounced by Tibetans and Buddhists who follow the [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan traditions]] as {{IAST|o\u1e43 t\u0101re tu t\u0101re ture soha}}.

She is the female aspect of [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] and in some origin stories she comes from his tears:\n\n\"Then at last Avalokiteshvara arrived at the summit of Marpori, the 'Red Hill', in Lhasa. Gazing out, he perceived that the lake on Otang, the 'Plain of Milk', resembled the Hell of Ceaseless Torment. Myriad beings were undergoing the agonies of boiling, burning, hunger, thirst, yet they never perished, sending forth hideous cries of anguish all the while. When Avalokiteshvara saw this, tears sprang to his eyes. A teardrop from his right eye fell to the plain and became the reverend [[Bhrikuti]], who declared: \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavour!\" Bhrikuti was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's right eye, and was reborn in a later life as the Nepalese princess Tritsun. A teardrop from his left eye fell upon the plain and became the reverend Tara. She also declared, \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavor!\" T\u0101r\u0101 was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's left eye.\"\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 manifests in many different forms. In Tibet, these forms included Green T\u0101r\u0101's manifestation as the Nepalese Princess ([[Bhrikuti]]),<ref>((Min Bahadur Shakya |title=The Life and Contribution of the Nepalese Princess Bhrikuti Devi to Tibetan History |year=2009 |publisher=Pilgrims Publishing})</ref> and White T\u0101r\u0101's manifestation as the Chinese princess Kongjo ([[Princess Wencheng]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Sakyapa Sonam Gyaltsen |title=The Clear Mirror: A Traditional Account of Tibet's Golden Age |year=1996 |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |pages=64\u201365 |isbn=1-55939-048-4 }}</ref>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 is also known as a [[salvation|saviouress]], as a heavenly deity who hears the cries of beings experiencing misery in [[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]].\n\nWhether the T\u0101r\u0101 figure originated as a Buddhist or Hindu goddess is unclear and remains a source of inquiry among scholars. Mallar Ghosh believes her to have originated as a form of the goddess [[Durga]] in the Hindu [[Puranas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Mallar Ghosh |title=Development of Buddhist Iconography in Eastern India |year=1980 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |page=17 |isbn=81-215-0208-X }}</ref> Today, she is worshiped both in Buddhism and in [[Shaktism]] (Hinduism) as one of the ten [[Mahavidya]]s. It may be true that goddesses entered Buddhism from Shaktism (i.e. the worship of local or folk goddesses prior to the more institutionalized [[Hinduism]] which had developed by the early medieval period (i.e. [[Middle kingdoms of India]]). According to Beyer, it would seem that the feminine principle makes its first appearance in Buddhism as the goddess who personified prajnaparamita.<ref name=\"beyer\">{{cite book |author=Stephen Beyer |title=The Cult of T\u0101r\u0101: Magic and Ritual in Tibet (Hermeneutics: Studies in the History of Religions) |year=1978 |publisher=University of California Press |pages= |isbn=0-520-03635-2 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:OM TARE TU TTARE.svg|thumb|left|<div align =\"center\">The Mantra of T\u0101r\u0101<br>''O\u1e40 T\u0100RE TUTT\u0100RE TURE SVAH\u0100'' <br>in the ''La\u00f1ja'' variant of [[Ranjana alphabet|Ranjana]] and [[Tibetan alphabet]]s.</div>]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 came to be seen as an expression of the compassion of perfected wisdom only later, with her earliest textual reference being the ''[[Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b-m\u016bla-kalpa]]'' (c. 5th\u20138th centuries CE).<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin Willson |title=In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101: Songs to the Saviouress |year=1992 |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |quote= | pages=40| url= |isbn=0-86171-109-2 }}</ref> The earliest, solidly identifiable image of T\u0101r\u0101 is most likely that which is still found today at cave 6 within the rock-cut Buddhist monastic complex of the [[Ellora Caves]] in [[Maharashtra]] (c. 7th century CE), with her worship being well established by the onset of the [[Pala Empire]] in [[Eastern India]] (8th century CE).<ref>{{cite book |author=Mallar Ghosh |title=Development of Buddhist Iconography in Eastern India |year=1980 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |page=6 |isbn=81-215-0208-X }}</ref>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 became a very popular [[Vajrayana]] deity with the rise of Tantra in 8th-century Pala and, with the movement of Indian Buddhism into Tibet through [[Padmasambhava]], the worship and practices of T\u0101r\u0101 became incorporated into Tibetan Buddhism as well.<ref name=\"beyer\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Khenchen Palden Sharab |author2=Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal  |title=Tara's Enlightened Activity: Commentary on the Praises to the Twenty-one Taras |year=2007 |publisher=[[Snow Lion Publications]] |page=13 |isbn=1-55939-287-8 }}</ref> She eventually came to be considered the \"Mother of all Buddhas,\" which usually refers to the enlightened wisdom of the Buddhas, while simultaneously echoing the ancient concept of the [[Mother Goddess]] in India.\n\nIndependent of whether she is classified as a deity, a Buddha, or a bodhisattva, T\u0101r\u0101 remains very popular in [[Tibet]] (and Tibetan communities in exile in Northern India), [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], Sikkim and is worshiped in a majority of Buddhist communities throughout the world (see also [[Guanyin]], the female aspect of Avalokitesvara in Chinese Buddhism).\n\nToday, Green Tara and White Tara are probably the most popular representations of Tara. Green Tara (''Khadiravani'') is usually associated with protection from fear and the following eight obscurations: lions (= pride), wild elephants (= delusion/ignorance), fires (= hatred and anger), snakes (= jealousy), bandits and thieves (= wrong views, including fanatical views), bondage (= avarice and miserliness), floods (= desire and attachment), and evil spirits and demons (= deluded doubts). As one of the three deities of long life, White Tara (''Saraswati'') is associated with longevity. White Tara counteracts illness and thereby helps to bring about a long life. She embodies the motivation that is compassion and is said to be as white and radiant as the moon.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:The Buddhist Goddess Shyama Tara (Green Tara) Attended by Sita Tara (White Tara) and Bhrikuti LACMA M.84.32.1a-d.jpg|Shyama Tara (Green Tara) Attended by Sita Tara (White Tara) and [[Bhrikuti]] (Yellow Tara). ca. 8th century.\nFile:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|''The Buddhist Goddess Tara'', gold and silver, Central Java, Indonesia, ca. 9th century.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]|url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/35047|title= The Buddhist Goddess Tara}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.\nFile:Green Tara.

Her name is Jnanachanrda or Yeshe Dawa, which means \"Moon of [[:wikt:primordial|Primordial]] Awareness\". For quite a number of [[aeon]]s she makes offerings to the Buddha of that world system, whose name was Tonyo Drupa. She receives special instruction from him concerning [[bodhicitta]] - the infinitely compassionate mental state of a bodhisattva. After doing this, some monks approach her and suggest that because of her level of attainment she should next pray to be reborn as a male to progress further. At this point she lets the monks know in no uncertain terms that it is only \"weak minded worldlings\" who see gender as a barrier to attaining [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. She sadly notes there have been few who wish to work for the welfare of sentient beings in a female form, though. Therefore, she resolves to always be reborn as a female bodhisattva, until [[samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]] is no more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/samhita-arni-points-out-how-caste-and-gender-prejudice-are-inextricably-linked/article17433634.ece|title=Gender doesn\u2019t come in the way of Nirvana|last=Arni|first=Samhita|date=2017-03-09|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-12-14|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> She then stays in a palace in a state of [[meditation]] for some ten million years, and the power of this practice releases tens of millions of beings from suffering. As a result of this, Tonyo Drupa tells her she will henceforth manifest supreme [[bodhi]] as the Goddess T\u0101r\u0101 in many world systems to come.\n\nWith this story in mind, it is interesting to juxtapose this with a quotation from the [[14th Dalai Lama]] about T\u0101r\u0101, spoken at a conference on Compassionate Action in Newport Beach, CA in 1989:\n\n<blockquote>There is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess T\u0101r\u0101. Following her cultivation of [[bodhicitta]], the bodhisattva's motivation, she looked upon the situation of those striving towards full awakening and she felt that there were too few people who attained [[Buddhahood]] as women. So she vowed, \"I have developed bodhicitta as a woman.

Bell Fund, 1966, 66.179.]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 also embodies many of the qualities of feminine principle. She is known as the Mother of Mercy and Compassion. She is the source, the female aspect of the universe, which gives birth to warmth, compassion and relief from bad karma as experienced by ordinary beings in cyclic existence. She engenders, nourishes, smiles at the vitality of creation, and has sympathy for all beings as a mother does for her children. As Green T\u0101r\u0101 she offers succor and protection from all the unfortunate circumstances one can encounter within the samsaric world. As White T\u0101r\u0101 she expresses maternal compassion and offers healing to beings who are hurt or wounded, either mentally or psychically. As Red T\u0101r\u0101 she teaches discriminating awareness about created phenomena, and how to turn raw desire into compassion and love. As Blue T\u0101r\u0101 ([[Ekajati]]) she becomes a protector in the [[Nyingma]] lineage, who expresses a ferocious, wrathful, female energy whose invocation destroys all Dharmic obstacles and engenders good luck and swift spiritual awakening.<ref name=\"beyer\"/>\n\nWithin [[Tibetan Buddhism]], she has 21 major forms in all, each tied to a certain color and energy. And each offers some feminine attribute, of ultimate benefit to the spiritual aspirant who asks for her assistance.\n\nAnother quality of feminine principle which she shares with the [[dakini]]s is playfulness. As [[John Blofeld]] expands upon in ''Bodhisattva of Compassion'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=Bodhisattva of Compassion: The Mystical Tradition of Kuan Yin |year=2009 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |quote= |url=https://archive.org/details/bodhisattvaofcom00john |isbn=1-59030-735-6 |url-access=registration }}</ref> T\u0101r\u0101 is frequently depicted as a young sixteen-year-old girlish woman. She often manifests in the lives of [[dharma]] practitioners when they take themselves, or the spiritual path too seriously. There are Tibetan tales in which she laughs at self-righteousness, or plays pranks on those who lack reverence for the feminine. In ''Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Thinley Norbu |title=Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis |year=1999 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |isbn=0-87773-885-8 }}</ref> Thinley Norbu explores this as \"Playmind\". Applied to T\u0101r\u0101 one could say that her playful mind can relieve ordinary minds which become rigidly serious or tightly gripped by dualistic distinctions. She takes delight in an open mind and a receptive heart then. For in this openness and receptivity her blessings can naturally unfold and her energies can quicken the aspirants spiritual development.\n\nThese qualities of feminine principle then, found an expression in Indian [[Mahayana]] Buddhism and the emerging [[Vajrayana]] of Tibet, as the many forms of T\u0101r\u0101, as dakinis, as [[Prajnaparamita]], and as many other local and specialized feminine divinities. As the worship of T\u0101r\u0101 developed, various prayers, chants and mantras became associated with her. These came out of a felt devotional need, and from her inspiration causing spiritual masters to compose and set down [[sadhana]]s, or tantric meditation practices. Two ways of approach to her began to emerge. In one common folk and lay practitioners would simply directly appeal to her to ease some of the travails of worldly life. In the second, she became a [[Tantra|Tantric]] deity whose practice would be used by monks or tantric yogis in order to develop her qualities in themselves, ultimately leading through her to the source of her qualities, which are [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]], Enlightened Compassion, and Enlightened Mind.\n\n==T\u0101r\u0101 as a Tantric deity==\n[[File:Tara thangka.jpg|thumb|right|18th-century Eastern [[Tibet]]an [[thanka]], with the Green Tara (Samaya Tara Yogini) in the center and the Blue, Red, White and Yellow taras in the corners, [[Rubin Museum of Art]]]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 as a focus for tantric deity [[yoga]] can be traced back to the time period of [[Padmasambhava]]. There is a Red T\u0101r\u0101 practice which was given by Padmasambhava to [[Yeshe Tsogyal]]. He asked that she [[terton|hide it as a treasure]]. It was not until the 20th century, that a great Nyingma lama, Apong Terton rediscovered it. It is said that this lama was reborn as [[Sakya Trizin]], present head of the [[Sakyapa]] sect. A monk who had known Apong Terton succeeded in retransmitting it to Sakya Trizin, and the same monk also gave it to [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], who released it to his western students.\n\nMartin Willson in ''In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101'' traces many different lineages of T\u0101r\u0101 Tantras, that is T\u0101r\u0101 scriptures used as Tantric sadhanas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin Willson |title=In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101: Songs to the Saviouress |year=1992 |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |quote= | pages=| url= |isbn=0-86171-109-2 }}</ref> For example, a T\u0101r\u0101 sadhana was revealed to [[Tilopa]] (988\u20131069 CE), the human father of the [[Karma Kagyu]]. [[Atisa]], the great translator and founder of the [[Kadampa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, was a devotee of T\u0101r\u0101. He composed a praise to her, and three T\u0101r\u0101 Sadhanas. Martin Willson's work also contains charts which show origins of her tantras in various lineages, but suffice to say that T\u0101r\u0101 as a tantric practice quickly spread from around the 7th century CE onwards, and remains an important part of Vajrayana Buddhism to this day.\n\nThe practices themselves usually present T\u0101r\u0101 as a tutelary deity (thug dam, [[yidam]]) which the practitioners sees as being a latent aspect of one's mind, or a manifestation in a visible form of a quality stemming from [[Jnana|Buddha Jnana]]. As John Blofeld puts it in ''The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet'':\n\n{{quote|The function of the Yidam is one of the profound mysteries of the Vajrayana...Especially during the first years of practice the Yidam is of immense importance. Yidam is the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit word \"I\u1e63\u1e6dadeva\"\u2014the in-dwelling deity; but, where the Hindus take the I\u1e63\u1e6dadeva for an actual deity who has been invited to dwell in the devotee's heart, the Yidams of Tantric Buddhism are in fact the emanations of the adepts own mind. Or are they? To some extent they seem to belong to that order of phenomena which in Jungian terms are called archetypes and are therefore the common property of the entire human race. Even among Tantric Buddhists, there may be a division of opinion as to how far the Yidams are the creations of individual minds. What is quite certain is that they are not independently existing gods and goddesses; and yet, paradoxically, there are many occasions when they must be so regarded.''<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet: A Practical Guide to the Theory, Purpose, and Techniques of Tantric Meditation |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |page=176 |isbn=0-14-019336-7 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:Kurukulla (Red Tara) - AMNH - DSC06232.JPG|thumb|[[Kurukulla]] thangka, American Museum of Natural History, Manhattan, New York City]]\n[[File:Sarasvati thangka.jpg|thumb|[[Sarasvati]] thangka, Eastern Tibet, 18th century]]\nThere are many forms of T\u0101r\u0101, including various popular lists of 21 different emanations of T\u0101r\u0101. Green T\u0101r\u0101, (\u015by\u0101mat\u0101r\u0101) associated with peacefulness and enlightened activity is the most depicted and the central aspect of T\u0101r\u0101 from which others such as the 21 T\u0101r\u0101s emanate. In her Green form, she is often also known as Khadirava\u1e47i-T\u0101r\u0101 (T\u0101r\u0101 of the acacia forest), who appeared to [[Nagarjuna]] in the Khadiravani forest of [[South India]] and protects from the eight great fears. She is often accompanied by her two attendants M\u0101r\u012bc\u012b and Ekaja\u1e6d\u0101. Dharmachari Purna writes on the various forms of Tara:\n\n<blockquote>T\u0101r\u0101 is in fact the name of a whole class of deities. She appears in all the five colours of the Jinas. There are at least ten green forms, seven white, five yellow, two blue and one red. As Sarvaj\u00f1amitra says of her form: 'It is a universal form, varied like crystal, since it changes according to circumstance'.She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her figure is shown in virtually all postures from standing to sitting, full lotus, half lotus, one leg down, and both legs down. There is apparently also a reclining T\u0101r\u0101. She has two-armed forms, four arms, eight arms, twelve arms, and Getty even mentions a Tibetan painting showing a standing T\u0101r\u0101 with 'one thousand heads and arms'. Ghosh lists seventy-six distinct forms of T\u0101r\u0101, and tradition tells us there are one hundred and eight names for her.<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Sarvajnamitra she has a \u201cuniversal form\u201d (''visva-rupa''), that encompasses all living beings and deities, and which changes with the needs of each being.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 337</ref>\n\nOther forms of T\u0101r\u0101 include:\n\n*White T\u0101r\u0101, (Sitat\u0101r\u0101) with two arms seated on a white lotus and with eyes on her hand and feet, as well as a third eye on her forehead (thus she is also known as \"Seven eyed\").

Apart from her many emanations named T\u0101r\u0101 of varying colors, other Mahayana female divinities that became part of Tara's theology include [[Janguli]], [[Parnasabari]], Cunda, [[Kurukulla]], [[Mahamayuri]], [[Usnisavijaya]], and [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marici]]. Based on this principle of T\u0101r\u0101 as the central female divinity, [[Dakinis]] were also seen as emanations of her.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 341</ref>\n\n==Sadhanas of T\u0101r\u0101==\n[[File:Tara, Gyantse Kumbum.JPG|thumb|Tara statue. [[Gyantse]] Kumbum. 1993]]\n[[Sadhana]]s in which T\u0101r\u0101 is the [[yidam]] (meditational deity) can be extensive or quite brief. Most all of them include some introductory praises or homages to invoke her presence and prayers of taking refuge. Then her [[mantra]] is recited, followed by a visualization of her, perhaps more mantra, then the visualization is dissolved, followed by a dedication of the merit from doing the practice. Additionally there may be extra prayers of aspirations, and a long life prayer for the Lama who originated the practice. Many of the T\u0101r\u0101 sadhanas are seen as beginning practices within the world of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], however what is taking place during the visualization of the deity actually invokes some of the most sublime teachings of all Buddhism. Two examples are Zabtik Drolchok<ref>http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Zabtik_Drolchok</ref> and Chime Pakme Nyingtik.<ref>http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chim%C3%A9_Phakm%C3%A9_Nyingtik</ref>\n\nIn this case during the creation phase of T\u0101r\u0101 as a yidam, she is seen as having as much reality as any other phenomena apprehended through the mind. By reciting her mantra and visualizing her form in front, or on the head of the adept, one is opening to her energies of compassion and wisdom. After a period of time the practitioner shares in some of these qualities, becomes imbued with her being and all it represents. At the same time all of this is seen as coming out of Emptiness and having a translucent quality like a rainbow. Then many times there is a visualization of oneself as T\u0101r\u0101. One simultaneously becomes inseparable from all her good qualities while at the same time realizing the emptiness of the visualization of oneself as the [[yidam]] and also the emptiness of one's ordinary self.\n\nThis occurs in the completion stage of the practice. One dissolves the created deity form and at the same time also realizes how much of what we call the \"self\" is a creation of the mind, and has no long term substantial inherent existence. This part of the practice then is preparing the practitioner to be able to confront the dissolution of one's self at death and ultimately be able to approach through various stages of meditation upon emptiness, the realization of Ultimate Truth as a vast display of [[Emptiness]] and Luminosity. At the same time the recitation of the mantra has been invoking T\u0101r\u0101's energy through its [[Sanskrit]] [[seed syllable]]s and this purifies and activates certain psychic centers of the body ([[chakras]]). This also untangles knots of psychic energy which have hindered the practitioner from developing a Vajra body, which is necessary to be able to progress to more advanced practices and deeper stages of realization.\n\nTherefore, even in a simple T\u0101r\u0101 [[sadhana]] a plethora of outer, inner, and secret events is taking place and there are now many works such as ''Deity Yoga'', compiled by the present Dalai Lama,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] |title=Deity Yoga: In Action and Performance Tantra |year=1987 |publisher=[[Snow Lion Publications]] |quote= | url= |isbn=0-937938-50-5 }}</ref> which explores all the ramifications of working with a [[yidam]] in Tantric practices.\n\nThe end results of doing such T\u0101r\u0101 practices are many. For one thing it reduces the forces of delusion in the forms of negative karma, sickness, afflictions of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]], and other obstacles and obscurations.\n\nThe mantra helps generate Bodhicitta within the heart of the practitioner and purifies the psychic channels ([[nadis]]) within the body allowing a more natural expression of generosity and compassion to flow from the heart center. Through experiencing T\u0101r\u0101's perfected form one acknowledges one's own perfected form, that is one's intrinsic Buddha nature, which is usually covered over by obscurations and clinging to dualistic [[phenomena]] as being inherently real and permanent.\n\nThe practice then weans one away from a coarse understanding of Reality, allowing one to get in touch with inner qualities similar to those of a bodhisattva, and prepares one's inner self to embrace finer spiritual energies, which can lead to more subtle and profound realizations of the Emptiness of phenomena and self.\n\nAs [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], in his ''Introduction to the Red T\u0101r\u0101 Sadhana'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] |title=Red Tara Commentary: Instructions for the Concise Practice Known as Red Tara\u2014An Open Door to Bliss |year=1998 |publisher=Padma Publishing |quote= | url= |isbn=1-881847-04-7 }}</ref> notes of his lineage: \"T\u0101r\u0101 is the flawless expression of the inseparability of emptiness, awareness and compassion. Just as you use a mirror to see your face, T\u0101r\u0101 [[meditation]] is a means of seeing the true face of your mind, devoid of any trace of delusion\".\n\nThere are several preparations to be done before practising the Sadhana. To perform a correct execution the practitioner must be prepared and take on the proper disposition. The preparations may be grouped as \"internal\" and \"external\". Both are necessary to achieve the required concentration.\n\n<blockquote>The preparations are of two types: external and internal. The external preparations consist of cleaning the meditation room, setting up a shrine with images of Buddha Shakyamuni and Green Tara, and setting out a beautiful arrangement of offerings.  We can use water to represent nectar for drinking, water for bathing the feet, and perfume. For the remaining offerings\u2014flowers, incense, light, and pure food\u2014if possible we should set out the actual substances. As for internal preparations, we should try to improve our compassion, bodhichitta, and correct view of emptiness through the practice of the stages of the path, and to receive a Tantric empowerment of Green Tara. It is possible to participate in group pujas if we have not yet received an empowerment, but to gain deep experience of this practice we need to receive an empowerment. The main internal preparation is to generate and strengthen our faith in Arya Tara, regarding her as the synthesis of all Gurus, Yidams, and Buddhas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905093605/http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-05 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tara statue near Kulu.jpg|Tara statue near [[Kullu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], India.\nFile:Ratnagiri ei3-40.jpg|Medititating Tara, [[Ratnagiri, Odisha]], India, 8th century\nFile:White Tara statue manor place 291107.jpg|White Tara statue in a [[Karma Kagyu]] [[dharma centre]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Terma teachings related to T\u0101r\u0101==\n[[Terma (Buddhism)|Terma]] teachings are \"hidden teachings\" said to have been left by [[Padmasambhava]] (8th century) and others for the benefit of future generations.

However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.\n\n[[File:Koeh-232.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oryza sativa]]'', commonly known as Asian rice]]\nThe traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters [[vermin]]. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of [[irrigation]] require higher effort in [[Weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]] during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.\n\nThe name [[wild rice]] is usually used for species of the genera ''[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]'' and ''[[Porteresia]]'', both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of ''[[Oryza]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word \"rice\" derives from the [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|ris}}, which comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|riso}}, in turn from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|or\u0233za}}, which derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|oruza}}).

Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batters]] and breadings to increase crispiness.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Stages of rice milling.jpg|thumb|Unmilled to milled rice, from left to right, [[brown rice]], rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]], [[white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'']]\n[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]<br>B: [[Brown rice]]<br>C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]<br>D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:\u7121\u6d17\u7c73|\u7121\u6d17\u7c73]]), \"Polished and ready to boil rice\", literally, non-wash rice<br>(1): [[Chaff]]<br>(2): [[Bran]]<br>(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>(4): [[Cereal germ]]<br>(5): [[Endosperm]]]]\n\nRice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess [[starch]]. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]].

This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.<ref>The Best Way to Cook Rice is All About the Right Ratio- What's Eating Dan? [[America's Test Kitchen]]</ref> With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] or [[biryani]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] .\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Rice may be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Food==\n===Nutrition===\nRice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa.

Partaking of the ''bayah'' (rice beer), rice cakes, and [[betel nut]] constitutes an indelible practise during the festivities.\n\nThe Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labor at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also<ref name=\"tourism.gov.ph\" /> been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao's rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance.

[[Agriculture in Sri Lanka]] mainly depends on the rice cultivation. Rice production is acutely dependent on rainfall and government supply necessity of water through irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons. The principal cultivation season, known as \"Maha\", is from October to March and the subsidiary cultivation season, known as \"Yala\", is from April to September. During Maha season, there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields, nevertheless in Yala season there is only enough water for cultivation of half of the land extent.

At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].\n\nFrom the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]].

It is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than one [[hectare]]. Rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population.\n\nMany rice grain producing countries have significant losses post-harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmer's inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. A World Bank \u2013 FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | title=Types of rice | publisher=Rice Association | access-date=August 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162740/http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | archive-date=August 2, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]].

Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually a week to 30 days \u2013 gaba rice).\n\nProcessed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.\n\nRice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name=\"Protein content\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G.

This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm\u00b3. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.\n\n===Harvesting, drying and milling===\n[[File:Rice-combine-harvester, Katori-city, Japan.jpg|thumb|Rice combine harvester [[Katori, Chiba|Katori-city]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]\n[[File:Rice farmers Mae Wang Chiang Mai Province.jpg|thumb|After the harvest, rice straw is gathered in the traditional way from small paddy fields in [[Mae Wang District]], [[Chiang Mai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]\n{{Further|Paddy field}}\n<!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section -->\nUnmilled rice, known as \"paddy\" (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008).

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]).

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence. Ongoing research in China to develop [[perennial rice]] could result in enhanced sustainability and [[food security]].\n\n=== Golden rice ===\n{{Main|Golden rice}}\nRice kernels do not contain [[vitamin A]], so people who obtain most of their calories from rice are at risk of [[vitamin A deficiency]].

Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=J.|last2=Hu|first2=C.|last3=Yan|first3=X.|last4=Jin|first4=Y.|last5=Chen|first5=Z.|last6=Guan|first6=Q.|last7=Wang|first7=Y.|last8=Zhong|first8=D.|last9=Jansson|first9=C.|last10=Wang|first10=F.|last11=Schn\u00fcrer|first11=A.|last12=Sun|first12=C.|title=Expression of barley SUSIBA2 transcription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice|journal=Nature|date=July 22, 2015|volume=523|issue=7562|pages=602\u201306|doi=10.1038/nature14673|bibcode=2015Natur.523..602S|pmid=26200336}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gerry|title=Feeding the World One Genetically Modified Tomato at a Time: A Scientific Perspective|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|website=SITN|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=2015-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910164510/http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Meiosis and DNA repair==\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and [[DNA repair]] in higher plants.

However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.\n\n[[File:Koeh-232.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oryza sativa]]'', commonly known as Asian rice]]\nThe traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters [[vermin]]. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of [[irrigation]] require higher effort in [[Weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]] during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.\n\nThe name [[wild rice]] is usually used for species of the genera ''[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]'' and ''[[Porteresia]]'', both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of ''[[Oryza]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word \"rice\" derives from the [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|ris}}, which comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|riso}}, in turn from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|or\u0233za}}, which derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|oruza}}).

Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for ''[[risotto]]'' in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as ''[[arr\u00f2s negre]]'', in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in [[amylopectin]], known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|title=White Sticky Rice \u2013 Kao Niow|author=Loha-unchit, Kasma|accessdate=October 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013231727/http://thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|archive-date=October 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> A stickier medium-grain rice is used for ''[[sushi]]''; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batters]] and breadings to increase crispiness.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Stages of rice milling.jpg|thumb|Unmilled to milled rice, from left to right, [[brown rice]], rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]], [[white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'']]\n[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]<br>B: [[Brown rice]]<br>C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]<br>D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:\u7121\u6d17\u7c73|\u7121\u6d17\u7c73]]), \"Polished and ready to boil rice\", literally, non-wash rice<br>(1): [[Chaff]]<br>(2): [[Bran]]<br>(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>(4): [[Cereal germ]]<br>(5): [[Endosperm]]]]\n\nRice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess [[starch]]. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]].

This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.<ref>The Best Way to Cook Rice is All About the Right Ratio- What's Eating Dan? [[America's Test Kitchen]]</ref> With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] or [[biryani]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] .\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is also used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Rice may also be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is also a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Food==\n===Nutrition===\nRice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa.

Partaking of the ''bayah'' (rice beer), rice cakes, and [[betel nut]] constitutes an indelible practise during the festivities.\n\nThe Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labor at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also<ref name=\"tourism.gov.ph\" /> been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao's rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance.

[[Agriculture in Sri Lanka]] mainly depends on the rice cultivation. Rice production is acutely dependent on rainfall and government supply necessity of water through irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons. The principal cultivation season, known as \"Maha\", is from October to March and the subsidiary cultivation season, known as \"Yala\", is from April to September. During Maha season, there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields, nevertheless in Yala season there is only enough water for cultivation of half of the land extent.

At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].\n\nFrom the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]].

It is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than one [[hectare]]. Rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population.\n\nMany rice grain producing countries have significant losses post-harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmer's inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. A World Bank \u2013 FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | title=Types of rice | publisher=Rice Association | access-date=August 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162740/http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | archive-date=August 2, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]].

Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually a week to 30 days \u2013 gaba rice).\n\nProcessed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.\n\nRice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name=\"Protein content\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G.

This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm\u00b3. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.\n\n===Harvesting, drying and milling===\n[[File:Rice-combine-harvester, Katori-city, Japan.jpg|thumb|Rice combine harvester [[Katori, Chiba|Katori-city]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]\n[[File:Rice farmers Mae Wang Chiang Mai Province.jpg|thumb|After the harvest, rice straw is gathered in the traditional way from small paddy fields in [[Mae Wang District]], [[Chiang Mai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]\n{{Further|Paddy field}}\n<!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section -->\nUnmilled rice, known as \"paddy\" (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008).

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]).

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence. Ongoing research in China to develop [[perennial rice]] could result in enhanced sustainability and [[food security]].\n\n=== Golden rice ===\n{{Main|Golden rice}}\nRice kernels do not contain [[vitamin A]], so people who obtain most of their calories from rice are at risk of [[vitamin A deficiency]].

This is mostly seen in Hispanic people who do not speak English. \n* '''Structural barriers'''. These barriers include poor transportation, an inability to schedule appointments quickly or during convenient hours, and excessive time spent in the waiting room, all of which affect a person's ability and willingness to obtain needed care.<ref>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), \"National Healthcare Disparities Report,\" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (July 2003).</ref>\n* '''The health care financing system'''. The [[Institute of Medicine]] in the United States says fragmentation of the U.S. health care delivery and financing system is a barrier to accessing care. Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be enrolled in health insurance plans which place limits on covered services and offer a limited number of health care providers.<ref name=\"Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10\"/>\n* '''Scarcity of providers'''.

Age can also be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care expenses difficult.

The patient provider relationship is dependent on the ability of both individuals to effectively communicate.  Language and culture both play a significant role in communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians.  Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask.<ref name=\"Health Care Quality Survey\">{{cite web|title=Health Care Quality Survey|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Surveys/2001/2001-Health-Care-Quality-Survey.aspx|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund 2001}}</ref> In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time.<ref name=\"Health Care Quality Survey\" /> Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Betancourt|first=J.

Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater.  Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one.

Advocacy for health equity has been identified as a key means of promoting favourable policy change.<ref>Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health. Final Report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. 2008. Available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf.</ref> EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature. It found, amongst other things, that certain kinds of evidence may be more persuasive in advocacy efforts, that practices associated with knowledge transfer and translation can increase the uptake of knowledge, that there are many different potential advocates and targets of advocacy and that advocacy efforts need to be tailored according to context and target.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Farrer L. |author2=Marinetti C. |author3=Cavaco Y.

One source of health inequity stems from unequal treatment of non-white patients in comparison with white patients. Creating provider based incentives to create greater parity between treatment of white and non-white patients is one proposed solution to eliminate provider bias.<ref>http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf</ref> These incentives typically are monetary because of its effectiveness in influencing physician behavior. \n* '''Using Evidence Based Medicine (EBM)'''. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) shows promise in reducing healthcare provider bias in turn promoting health equity.<ref>Betancourt, J. R., & Maina, A. (2007). Barriers to Eliminating Disparities in Clinical Practice. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (83-98). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.</ref> In theory EBM can reduce disparities however other research suggests that it might exacerbate them instead. Some cited shortcomings include EBM\u2019s injection of clinical inflexibility in decision making and its origins as a purely cost driven measure.<ref>Maxey, R. W., & Williams, R. A. (2007). Second Class Medicine: Implications of Evidence-Based Medicine for Improving Minority Access to the Correct Pharmaceutical Therapy. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (99-120). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.</ref> \n* '''Increasing awareness'''. The most cited measure to improving health equity relates to increasing public awareness. A lack of public awareness is a key reason why there has not been significant gains in reducing health disparities in ethnic and minority populations. Increased public awareness would lead to increased congressional awareness, greater availability of disparity data, and further research into the issue of health disparities.\n* '''The Gradient Evaluation Framework'''. The evidence base defining which policies and interventions are most effective in reducing health inequalities is extremely weak. It is important therefore that policies and interventions which seek to influence health inequity be more adequately evaluated. Gradient Evaluation Framework (GEF) is an action-oriented policy tool that can be applied to assess whether policies will contribute to greater health equity amongst children and their families.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/gef-the-gradient-evaluation-framework/ | title=Health Gradient &#124; EuroHealthNet}}</ref>\n* '''The AIM framework'''. In a pilot study, researchers examined the role of AIM\u2014ability, incentives, and management feedback\u2014in reducing care disparity in pressure-ulcer detection between African American and Caucasian residents. The results showed that while the program was implemented, the provision of (1) training to enhance ability, (2) monetary incentives to enhance motivation, and (3) management feedback to enhance accountability led to successful reduction in pressure ulcers. Specifically, the detection gap between the two groups decreased. The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework.\n* '''Monitoring actions on the social determinants of health'''. In 2017, citing the need for accountability for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social determinants of health that improve health equity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |pmid=29147060 |pmc=5677605 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784\u2013787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}</ref>\n*'''Changing the distribution of health services.''' Health services play a major role in health equity. Health inequities stem from lack of access to care due to poor economic status and an interaction among other [[social determinants of health]]. The majority of high quality health services are distributed among the wealthy people in society, leaving those who are poor with limited options. In order to change this fact and move towards achieving health equity, it is essential that health care increases in areas or neighborhoods consisting of low socioeconomic families and individuals.<ref name=\":8\" />\n*'''Prioritize treatment among the poor.''' Because of the challenges that arise from accessing health care with low economic status, many illnesses and injuries go untreated or are not given sufficient treatment. Promoting treatment as a priority among the poor will give them the resources they need in order to achieve good health, because health is a basic human right.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==Health inequalities==\nHealth inequality is the term used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups (not necessarily ethnic or racial groups) differs despite comparative access to health care services. Such examples include higher rates of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] for those in lower occupational classes than those in higher occupational classes, and the increased likelihood of those from ethnic minorities being diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In [[Canada]], the issue was brought to public attention by the [[LaLonde report]].\n\nIn [[UK]], the [[Black Report]] was produced in 1980 to highlight inequalities. On 11 February 2010, Sir [[Michael Marmot]], an epidemiologist at University College London, published the ''Fair Society, Healthy Lives'' report on the relationship between health and poverty. Marmot described his findings as illustrating a \"social gradient in health\": the life expectancy for the poorest is seven years shorter than for the most wealthy, and the poor are more likely to have a disability. In its report on this study, ''The Economist'' argued that the material causes of this contextual health inequality include unhealthful lifestyles - smoking remains more common, and obesity is increasing fastest, amongst the poor in Britain.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15501633|title=In sickness and in health|journal=The Economist|date=11 February 2010|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, the [[European Commission]] launched the [[Joint Action Health Equity in Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/chafea/news/news599.html|title=IA new Joint Action to tackle health inequalities in Europe|date= 21\u201322 June 2018|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref> Forty-nine participants from 25 [[European Union]] Member States will work together to address health inequalities and the underlying [[social determinants of health]] across Europe. Under the coordination of the [[Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0|Italian Institute of Public Health]], the Joint Action aims to achieve greater equity in health in Europe across all social groups while reducing the inter-country heterogeneity in tackling health inequalities.\n\n==Poor health and economic inequality==\n[[Economic inequality#Health|Poor health outcomes appear to be an effect of economic inequality]] across a population.

On an international level, there is a positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity. This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations.<ref>Figure 1.3. Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press.</ref> Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately $25,000.\nThe United States shows exceptionally low health outcomes for a developed country, despite having the highest national healthcare expenditure in the world. The US ranks 31st in life expectancy. Americans have a lower life expectancy than their European counterparts, even when factors such as race, income, diet, smoking, and education are controlled for.<ref>In Woolf, S. H., In Aron, L. Y., National Academies (U.S.)., & Institute of Medicine (U.S.). (2013). U.S. health in international perspective: Shorter lives, poorer health.</ref>\n\nRelative inequality negatively affects health on an international, national, and institutional levels. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States, that is, more equal states show more desirable health outcomes. Importantly, inequality can have a negative health impact on members of lower echelons of institutions. The [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall I and II]] studies looked at the rates of cardiovascular disease and other health risks in British civil servants and found that, even when lifestyle factors were controlled for, members of lower status in the institution showed increased mortality and morbidity on a sliding downward scale from their higher status counterparts.\nThe negative aspects of inequality are spread across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels.<ref>Figure 13.2. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger.

This is where patients have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information.

Age can also be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care expenses difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brodie M, Flournoy RE, Altman DE | year = 2000 | title = Health information, the Internet, and the digital divide | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 255\u201365 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.19.6.255| pmid = 11192412 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it.

The patient provider relationship is dependent on the ability of both individuals to effectively communicate.  Language and culture both play a significant role in communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians.  Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask.<ref name=\"Health Care Quality Survey\">{{cite web|title=Health Care Quality Survey|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Surveys/2001/2001-Health-Care-Quality-Survey.aspx|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund 2001}}</ref> In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time.<ref name=\"Health Care Quality Survey\" /> Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Betancourt|first=J.

Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater.  Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one.

Advocacy for health equity has been identified as a key means of promoting favourable policy change.<ref>Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health. Final Report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. 2008. Available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf.</ref> EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature. It found, amongst other things, that certain kinds of evidence may be more persuasive in advocacy efforts, that practices associated with knowledge transfer and translation can increase the uptake of knowledge, that there are many different potential advocates and targets of advocacy and that advocacy efforts need to be tailored according to context and target.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Farrer L. |author2=Marinetti C. |author3=Cavaco Y.

One source of health inequity stems from unequal treatment of non-white patients in comparison with white patients. Creating provider based incentives to create greater parity between treatment of white and non-white patients is one proposed solution to eliminate provider bias.<ref>http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf</ref> These incentives typically are monetary because of its effectiveness in influencing physician behavior. \n* '''Using Evidence Based Medicine (EBM)'''. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) shows promise in reducing healthcare provider bias in turn promoting health equity.<ref>Betancourt, J. R., & Maina, A. (2007). Barriers to Eliminating Disparities in Clinical Practice. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (83-98). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.</ref> In theory EBM can reduce disparities however other research suggests that it might exacerbate them instead. Some cited shortcomings include EBM\u2019s injection of clinical inflexibility in decision making and its origins as a purely cost driven measure.<ref>Maxey, R. W., & Williams, R. A. (2007). Second Class Medicine: Implications of Evidence-Based Medicine for Improving Minority Access to the Correct Pharmaceutical Therapy. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (99-120). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.</ref> \n* '''Increasing awareness'''. The most cited measure to improving health equity relates to increasing public awareness. A lack of public awareness is a key reason why there has not been significant gains in reducing health disparities in ethnic and minority populations. Increased public awareness would lead to increased congressional awareness, greater availability of disparity data, and further research into the issue of health disparities.\n* '''The Gradient Evaluation Framework'''. The evidence base defining which policies and interventions are most effective in reducing health inequalities is extremely weak. It is important therefore that policies and interventions which seek to influence health inequity be more adequately evaluated. Gradient Evaluation Framework (GEF) is an action-oriented policy tool that can be applied to assess whether policies will contribute to greater health equity amongst children and their families.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/gef-the-gradient-evaluation-framework/ | title=Health Gradient &#124; EuroHealthNet}}</ref>\n* '''The AIM framework'''. In a pilot study, researchers examined the role of AIM\u2014ability, incentives, and management feedback\u2014in reducing care disparity in pressure-ulcer detection between African American and Caucasian residents. The results showed that while the program was implemented, the provision of (1) training to enhance ability, (2) monetary incentives to enhance motivation, and (3) management feedback to enhance accountability led to successful reduction in pressure ulcers. Specifically, the detection gap between the two groups decreased. The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework.\n* '''Monitoring actions on the social determinants of health'''. In 2017, citing the need for accountability for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social determinants of health that improve health equity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |pmid=29147060 |pmc=5677605 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784\u2013787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}</ref>\n*'''Changing the distribution of health services.''' Health services play a major role in health equity. Health inequities stem from lack of access to care due to poor economic status and an interaction among other [[social determinants of health]]. The majority of high quality health services are distributed among the wealthy people in society, leaving those who are poor with limited options. In order to change this fact and move towards achieving health equity, it is essential that health care increases in areas or neighborhoods consisting of low socioeconomic families and individuals.<ref name=\":8\" />\n*'''Prioritize treatment among the poor.''' Because of the challenges that arise from accessing health care with low economic status, many illnesses and injuries go untreated or are not given sufficient treatment. Promoting treatment as a priority among the poor will give them the resources they need in order to achieve good health, because health is a basic human right.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==Health inequalities==\nHealth inequality is the term used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups (not necessarily ethnic or racial groups) differs despite comparative access to health care services. Such examples include higher rates of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] for those in lower occupational classes than those in higher occupational classes, and the increased likelihood of those from ethnic minorities being diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In [[Canada]], the issue was brought to public attention by the [[LaLonde report]].\n\nIn [[UK]], the [[Black Report]] was produced in 1980 to highlight inequalities. On 11 February 2010, Sir [[Michael Marmot]], an epidemiologist at University College London, published the ''Fair Society, Healthy Lives'' report on the relationship between health and poverty. Marmot described his findings as illustrating a \"social gradient in health\": the life expectancy for the poorest is seven years shorter than for the most wealthy, and the poor are more likely to have a disability. In its report on this study, ''The Economist'' argued that the material causes of this contextual health inequality include unhealthful lifestyles - smoking remains more common, and obesity is increasing fastest, amongst the poor in Britain.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15501633|title=In sickness and in health|journal=The Economist|date=11 February 2010|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, the [[European Commission]] launched the [[Joint Action Health Equity in Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/chafea/news/news599.html|title=IA new Joint Action to tackle health inequalities in Europe|date= 21\u201322 June 2018|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref> Forty-nine participants from 25 [[European Union]] Member States will work together to address health inequalities and the underlying [[social determinants of health]] across Europe. Under the coordination of the [[Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0|Italian Institute of Public Health]], the Joint Action aims to achieve greater equity in health in Europe across all social groups while reducing the inter-country heterogeneity in tackling health inequalities.\n\n==Poor health and economic inequality==\n[[Economic inequality#Health|Poor health outcomes appear to be an effect of economic inequality]] across a population.

On an international level, there is a positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity. This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations.<ref>Figure 1.3. Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press.</ref> Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately $25,000.\nThe United States shows exceptionally low health outcomes for a developed country, despite having the highest national healthcare expenditure in the world. The US ranks 31st in life expectancy. Americans have a lower life expectancy than their European counterparts, even when factors such as race, income, diet, smoking, and education are controlled for.<ref>In Woolf, S. H., In Aron, L. Y., National Academies (U.S.)., & Institute of Medicine (U.S.). (2013). U.S. health in international perspective: Shorter lives, poorer health.</ref>\n\nRelative inequality negatively affects health on an international, national, and institutional levels. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States, that is, more equal states show more desirable health outcomes. Importantly, inequality can have a negative health impact on members of lower echelons of institutions. The [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall I and II]] studies looked at the rates of cardiovascular disease and other health risks in British civil servants and found that, even when lifestyle factors were controlled for, members of lower status in the institution showed increased mortality and morbidity on a sliding downward scale from their higher status counterparts.\nThe negative aspects of inequality are spread across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels.<ref>Figure 13.2. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger.

And among many prawn resources, Ginger Prawn plays a significant role in the region as its highly seasonal during monsoon and indigenous of the species. The area which is dry during summers ranging from October\u2013June, However, with the outset of monsoon, the fresh waters from [[Banas River|Banas]], [[Sarasvati River|Saraswati]] and [[Machchhu River|Machchu]] mix with the salty waters of Gulf of Kutch, This brings in an enormous influx of Ginger prawn juveniles into the Rann of Kutch, which is exploited in mass scale. Juveniles of Ginger Prawn which are also known as \u201cSurajbari\" prawns as fish processing units in [[Gujarat]] procure them from Surajbari area in the region. Apart from monsoon rains in the region, other chemical and biological parameters pertaining to the water in the region also play an important role in the growth of these species from the stage of [[larva]]e to flourishing fishery around this region. The fishing in the region dates back to the early 16th century, During this period Muslim fishermen used to engage in fishing only for sustenance. The casting and retrieval of fishing nets were carried out manually by hand and the entire fishing operation was carried out barefoot. This way of fishing was known as \"Pagadia fishing\" which is in practice even today in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gyanaranjan Dash, Swatipriyanka Sen,M Koya, KR Sreenath|first=Suresh Kumar Mojjada, and HM Bhint|date=2012|title=Ginger Prawn Fishery in Gulf of Kutch: A Seasonal Livelihood for the Traditional Fishermen|url=https://www.asianagrihistory.org/pdf/research/ginger-prawn-16-4.pdf|journal=Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute|volume=Asian Agri-History Vol. 16, No. 4|pages=1\u20139|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Damming Rann of Kutch===\n[[Government of Gujarat|Gujarat government]] is studying to dam the 1.26&nbsp;km stretch of Hadakiya Creek of Rann of Kutch area so that impounded monsoon water can be used for recreational and fisheries purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eye on 2019 polls?

Among many fishery resources, Prawn resources play a major role due to its high demand both in Domestic and International markets. And among many prawn resources, Ginger Prawn plays a significant role in the region as its highly seasonal during monsoon and indigenous of the species. The area which is dry during summers ranging from October\u2013June, However, with the outset of monsoon, the fresh waters from [[Banas River|Banas]], [[Sarasvati River|Saraswati]] and [[Machchhu River|Machchu]] mix with the salty waters of Gulf of Kutch, This brings in an enormous influx of Ginger prawn juveniles into the Rann of Kutch, which is exploited in mass scale. Juveniles of Ginger Prawn which are also known as \u201cSurajbari\" prawns as fish processing units in [[Gujarat]] procure them from Surajbari area in the region. Apart from monsoon rains in the region, other chemical and biological parameters pertaining to the water in the region also play an important role in the growth of these species from the stage of [[larva]]e to flourishing fishery around this region. The fishing in the region dates back to the early 16th century, During this period Muslim fishermen used to engage in fishing only for sustenance. The casting and retrieval of fishing nets were carried out manually by hand and the entire fishing operation was carried out barefoot. This way of fishing was known as \"Pagadia fishing\" which is in practice even today in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gyanaranjan Dash, Swatipriyanka Sen,M Koya, KR Sreenath|first=Suresh Kumar Mojjada, and HM Bhint|date=2012|title=Ginger Prawn Fishery in Gulf of Kutch: A Seasonal Livelihood for the Traditional Fishermen|url=https://www.asianagrihistory.org/pdf/research/ginger-prawn-16-4.pdf|journal=Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute|volume=Asian Agri-History Vol. 16, No. 4|pages=1\u20139|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Damming Rann of Kutch===\n[[Government of Gujarat|Gujarat government]] is studying to dam the 1.26&nbsp;km stretch of Hadakiya Creek of Rann of Kutch area so that impounded monsoon water can be used for recreational and fisheries purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eye on 2019 polls?
