She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous.

She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous. But then, the danger makes it more exciting.\" She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}}\n\nKarina Longworth notes how \"external\" Streep's performances are, \"chameleonic\" in her impersonation of characters, \"subsuming herself into them, rather than personifying them\". In her early roles such as ''Manhattan'' and ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', she was compared to both [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]], in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, \"I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable\".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Meryl Streep - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|Streep's star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]'']]\nMike Nichols, who directed Streep in ''Silkwood'', ''Heartburn'', ''Postcards from the Edge'', and ''Angels in America'', praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, \"In every role, she becomes a totally new human being.

In the 1960s he lived in [[Eastport, Maine]], where he represented members of the [[Passamaquoddy]] tribe in court and advocated for their civil rights. In 1968 he filed a land claim suit on the tribe's behalf. Immediately after filing the suit he was charged with [[constructive possession]] of six marijuana cigarettes. He was convicted on a [[felony#United States|felony]] charge and sentenced to prison. After an unsuccessful appeal process, he moved to Israel without serving his sentence. He returned to the United States in 1980 and practiced as a rabbi until his death. In 2020 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the state of Maine.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nGellers was born on May 2, 1936 in New York City. His father, Samuel J. Weitzen, was a doctor who had immigrated to the United States from Poland. Gellers's grandfather, great-grandfather and uncle were rabbis. His parents divorced when he was a child and his mother remarried Charles Gellers, a New York businessman.<ref name=gellersobit>{{Cite news| page = E1| last = Woodard| first = Colin| title = In memoriam: Remembering Don Gellers| work = [[Portland Press Herald]]| location = Portland, Maine| authorlink = Colin Woodard | date = 26 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nGellers attended [[Forest Hills High School]] and [[Northern Arizona University]]. He studied [[international law]] at [[Columbia University]] and served an [[internship]] at the [[United Nations]] before moving to Eastport, Maine in 1963 to open a law practice.<ref name=\"gellersobit\" />\n\n==Legal career in Maine==\n\nGellers moved to Eastport in 1963 with his wife, an artist, and opened a law practice. In May 1964 he agreed to represent five Passamaquoddy women who had been arrested for protesting at a construction site on disputed land on the nearby [[Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation | Indian Township reservation]]. Subsequently he became known for his support of the Passamaquoddy people, most of whom lived in poverty \"dire even by the standards of [[Washington County, Maine | Washington County]], the poorest in New England\".<ref name=unset1>{{Cite book| publisher = Maine Today Media| place = Portland, Maine | isbn = 978-0-692-29534-2| last = Woodard| first = Colin| url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=AftTCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PT16#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Unsettled| date = 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs well as representing them in court, something few lawyers were willing to do, Gellers advocated for the legal and civil rights of the Passamaquoddy people. Among his accomplishments were  changes that allowed the Indians to make [[local ordinance | ordinances]] on tribal property, to run their own housing authority, and to hunt on their own land. Gellers also helped members with custody cases and with obtaining small business loans. His efforts on behalf of the Passamaquoddy led to his receiving death threats and having signs with [[antisemitism | antisemitic]] slogans placed on his lawn. <ref name=quoddy>{{Cite news| pages = 1, 10| last = French| first = Edward| title = Advocate for tribe is finally issued pardon| work = [[The Quoddy Tides]]| location = Eastport, Maine| url = http://quoddytides.com/tribal-advocate-finally-pardoned-by-state1-10-2020.html | date = 10 January 2020}}</ref> \n\nIn his pursuit of justice for the Passamaquoddy people, Gellers often clashed with the police and other authorities. In 1965 he alerted state and national media when the county attorney chose not to prosecute five white men who had been accused in the beating death of an Indian man, and in 1967 he represented several Indians who had been involved in a fight with a policeman and who claimed to have been victims of police brutality as a consequence. <ref name=\"gellersobit\" />\n\nHe also worked with tribal leaders on a land claim that led to the [[Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton#Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act | Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act]] of 1980.<ref name=\"quoddy\" /> [[Tom Tureen]], who became the tribe's lawyer in the 1970s, worked for Gellers as an intern in the summer of 1967.<ref name=\"unset7\">{{cite news |last1=Woodard |first1=Colin |title=The Passamaquoddy\u2019s land claim case takes shape |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/05/the-passamaquoddys-land-claim-case-takes-shape/ |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=Portland Press Herald |date=5 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1968 Gellers filed a land claims suit on behalf of the Passamaquoddy tribe in Boston, claiming that the state of Maine \"owed the tribe in excess of $150 million and title to tens of thousands of acres of land illegally appropriated from their treaty lands on the eastern branch of the St. Croix River\". The suit was against the state of Massachusetts because Maine did not exist in 1794, when the tribe had signed its treaty with the government. Maine had been carved out of Massachusetts in 1820, and the treaty had been passed on to the newly created state, which had failed, it was alleged, to live up to its terms. Gellers hoped that Massachusetts would in turn \"sue Maine as an aggrieved sovereign\".<ref name=\"unset9\">{{cite news |last1=Woodard |first1=Colin |title=All the Passamaquoddy want is what belongs to them |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/07/all-the-passamaquoddy-want-is-what-belongs-to-them/ |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=Portland Press Herald |date=7 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nUpon his return from filing the land claims suit in Boston, Gellers was arrested and charged with \"constructive possession\" of six marijuana cigarettes which police claimed to have found in the pocket of a jacket hanging in Gellers's closet. Despite simple possession of marijuana having recently been downgraded to a misdemeanour, legal challenges to the new law made it technically possible to prosecute the case as a felony. At the direction of the Maine Attorney General this was done, with the prosecution being handled by the head of the Attorney General's criminal division. Gellers was found guilty in March 1969 and in May he was sentenced to two to four years in prison. As well as incarceration, the felony conviction meant \"automatic [[disbarment]]\".<ref name=\"unset10\">{{cite news |last1=Woodard |first1=Colin |title=The Eastport sting: Tribe\u2019s attorney comes home to cuffs |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/08/the-eastport-sting-tribes-attorney-comes-home-to-cuffs |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=Portland Press Herald |date=8 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nGellers appealed his conviction unsuccessfully over the course of two years.

He studied [[international law]] at [[Columbia University]] and served an [[internship]] at the [[United Nations]] before moving to Eastport, Maine in 1963 to open a law practice.<ref name=\"gellersobit\" />\n\n==Legal career in Maine==\n\nGellers moved to Eastport in 1963 with his wife, an artist, and opened a law practice. In May 1964 he agreed to represent five Passamaquoddy women who had been arrested for protesting at a construction site on disputed land on the nearby [[Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation | Indian Township reservation]]. Subsequently he became known for his support of the Passamaquoddy people, most of whom lived in poverty \"dire even by the standards of [[Washington County, Maine | Washington County]], the poorest in New England\".<ref name=unset1>{{Cite book| publisher = Maine Today Media| place = Portland, Maine | isbn = 978-0-692-29534-2| last = Woodard| first = Colin| url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=AftTCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PT16#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Unsettled| date = 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs well as representing them in court, something few lawyers were willing to do, Gellers advocated for the legal and civil rights of the Passamaquoddy people. Among his accomplishments were  changes that allowed the Indians to make [[local ordinance | ordinances]] on tribal property, to run their own housing authority, and to hunt on their own land. Gellers also helped members with custody cases and with obtaining small business loans. His efforts on behalf of the Passamaquoddy led to his receiving death threats and having signs with [[antisemitism | antisemitic]] slogans placed on his lawn. <ref name=quoddy>{{Cite news| pages = 1, 10| last = French| first = Edward| title = Advocate for tribe is finally issued pardon| work = [[The Quoddy Tides]]| location = Eastport, Maine| url = http://quoddytides.com/tribal-advocate-finally-pardoned-by-state1-10-2020.html | date = 10 January 2020}}</ref> \n\nIn his pursuit of justice for the Passamaquoddy people, Gellers often clashed with the police and other authorities. In 1965 he alerted state and national media when the county attorney chose not to prosecute five white men who had been accused in the beating death of an Indian man, and in 1967 he represented several Indians who had been involved in a fight with a policeman and who claimed to have been victims of police brutality as a consequence. <ref name=\"gellersobit\" />\n\nHe also worked with tribal leaders on a land claim that led to the [[Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton#Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act | Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act]] of 1980.<ref name=\"quoddy\" /> [[Tom Tureen]], who became the tribe's lawyer in the 1970s, worked for Gellers as an intern in the summer of 1967.<ref name=\"unset7\">{{cite news |last1=Woodard |first1=Colin |title=The Passamaquoddy\u2019s land claim case takes shape |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/05/the-passamaquoddys-land-claim-case-takes-shape/ |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=Portland Press Herald |date=5 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1968 Gellers filed a land claims suit on behalf of the Passamaquoddy tribe in Boston, claiming that the state of Maine \"owed the tribe in excess of $150 million and title to tens of thousands of acres of land illegally appropriated from their treaty lands on the eastern branch of the St. Croix River\". The suit was against the state of Massachusetts because Maine did not exist in 1794, when the tribe had signed its treaty with the government. Maine had been carved out of Massachusetts in 1820, and the treaty had been passed on to the newly created state, which had failed, it was alleged, to live up to its terms. Gellers hoped that Massachusetts would in turn \"sue Maine as an aggrieved sovereign\".<ref name=\"unset9\">{{cite news |last1=Woodard |first1=Colin |title=All the Passamaquoddy want is what belongs to them |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/07/all-the-passamaquoddy-want-is-what-belongs-to-them/ |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=Portland Press Herald |date=7 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nUpon his return from filing the land claims suit in Boston, Gellers was arrested and charged with \"constructive possession\" of six marijuana cigarettes which police claimed to have found in the pocket of a jacket hanging in Gellers's closet. Despite simple possession of marijuana having recently been downgraded to a misdemeanour, legal challenges to the new law made it technically possible to prosecute the case as a felony. At the direction of the Maine Attorney General this was done, with the prosecution being handled by the head of the Attorney General's criminal division. Gellers was found guilty in March 1969 and in May he was sentenced to two to four years in prison. As well as incarceration, the felony conviction meant \"automatic [[disbarment]]\".<ref name=\"unset10\">{{cite news |last1=Woodard |first1=Colin |title=The Eastport sting: Tribe\u2019s attorney comes home to cuffs |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/08/the-eastport-sting-tribes-attorney-comes-home-to-cuffs |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=Portland Press Herald |date=8 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nGellers appealed his conviction unsuccessfully over the course of two years.

It was first performed in Season 3, although it had been released on ''[[The Muppet Alphabet Album]]''. Along with [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]]'s \"[[Bein' Green]]\" and [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]]'s \"[[Rubber Duckie]]\", it is one of the show's most recognizable songs. The original version was made in 1971 and was one of the few Sesame Street sketches directed by [[Jim Henson]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to the Muppet Central articles on the \"Songs from the Street Boxed Set, people really liked cookies. In 1971, [[Jim Henson]] and his performers teamed with [[Jerry Juhl]], Joe Raposo and [[Jeff Moss]] to write a [[sketch comedy|sketch]] on each letter of the [[alphabet]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muppetcentral.com/articles/reviews/merchandise/songs_from_the_street.shtml |title=Muppet Central Articles - Songs from the Street Boxed Set|publisher=muppetcentral.com|accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref> ''C Is For Cookie'' derives from this project.\nActress [[Candice Bergen]] sang the song when she visited ''Sesame Street''.\n\nA version was included on ''[[Sesame Street Fever]]''.

At the end of the song once \"Cleopatra\" is carried away out of sight, Cookie Monster appears in Egyptian attire and pulls a cookie off the pyramid, causing it to collapse with a huge crash while he eats it.\n\nSince then, several authorized and unauthorized versions of the song have been produced, including \"funky\" and \"sweet\" versions released on the 2003 record ''Cookie Monster & the Girls''.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tunes.co.uk/tunes/featured/7506.html\n |title=C Is For Cookie - Cookie Monster & The Girls: Available at www.tunes.co.uk, the dance specialists\n|publisher=web.archive.org\n|accessdate=2008-05-19\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051130094425/http://www.tunes.co.uk/tunes/featured/7506.html |archivedate = 2005-11-30}} (via [[Internet Archive]])</ref> Laura Pace's review of the home video ''[[Elmo's World: The Street We Live On]]'' noted 'the bizarreness of \"C is for Cookie\" done in ''[[Aida]]''-style opera'.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04251/374529.stm\n|title=DVD/video shelves overflow with children's favorites and also-rans\n|publisher=www.post-gazette.com\n|accessdate=2008-05-19\n| first=Barbara\n| last=Vancheri\n| date=2004-09-07\n}}</ref> A short reprise of the song is also performed by Cookie Monster and the cast of ''Sesame Street'' on the 1975 album ''[[Bert & Ernie Sing-Along]]''. In addition, since the advent of YouTube, there have also been recordings of the song, regular and operatic, in reverse, under such titles as \"C Is For Cookie Reversed\" or \"Cheese Good For Fleas\" (which is what the phrase \"C is for Cookie\" sounds like dubbed backwards).\n\nConcerned about increased [[obesity]] rates in children, [[PBS]] announced that for its 36th season ''Sesame Street'' will have Cookie Monster promoting a more healthy approach to diet and nutrition. Cookie Monster listened to another character's song about cookies being a sometime food. At the end, Cookie Monster declared 'Now is sometimes!' and ate a cookie.

It was first performed in Season 3, although it had been released on ''[[The Muppet Alphabet Album]]''. Along with [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]]'s \"[[Bein' Green]]\" and [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]]'s \"[[Rubber Duckie]]\", it is one of the show's most recognizable songs. The original version was made in 1971 and was one of the few Sesame Street sketches directed by [[Jim Henson]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to the Muppet Central articles on the \"Songs from the Street Boxed Set, people really liked cookies.

At the end of the song once \"Cleopatra\" is carried away out of sight, Cookie Monster appears in Egyptian attire and pulls a cookie off the pyramid, causing it to collapse with a huge crash while he eats it.\n\nSince then, several authorized and unauthorized versions of the song have been produced, including \"funky\" and \"sweet\" versions released on the 2003 record ''Cookie Monster & the Girls''.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tunes.co.uk/tunes/featured/7506.html\n |title=C Is For Cookie - Cookie Monster & The Girls: Available at www.tunes.co.uk, the dance specialists\n|publisher=web.archive.org\n|accessdate=2008-05-19\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051130094425/http://www.tunes.co.uk/tunes/featured/7506.html |archivedate = 2005-11-30}} (via [[Internet Archive]])</ref> Laura Pace's review of the home video ''[[Elmo's World: The Street We Live On]]'' noted 'the bizarreness of \"C is for Cookie\" done in ''[[Aida]]''-style opera'.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04251/374529.stm\n|title=DVD/video shelves overflow with children's favorites and also-rans\n|publisher=www.post-gazette.com\n|accessdate=2008-05-19\n| first=Barbara\n| last=Vancheri\n| date=2004-09-07\n}}</ref> A short reprise of the song is also performed by Cookie Monster and the cast of ''Sesame Street'' on the 1975 album ''[[Bert & Ernie Sing-Along]]''. In addition, since the advent of YouTube, there have also been recordings of the song, regular and operatic, in reverse, under such titles as \"C Is For Cookie Reversed\" or \"Cheese Good For Fleas\" (which is what the phrase \"C is for Cookie\" sounds like dubbed backwards).\n\nConcerned about increased [[obesity]] rates in children, [[PBS]] announced that for its 36th season ''Sesame Street'' will have Cookie Monster promoting a more healthy approach to diet and nutrition. Cookie Monster listened to another character's song about cookies being a sometime food. At the end, Cookie Monster declared 'Now is sometimes!' and ate a cookie. This is nothing new however, as Cookie also did a rap music video called \"Healthy Food\" in the mid-1980s where he sings about healthy food like bread, fruits and vegetables with assorted muppets (most of whom are themselves singing, googly-eyed breads, fruits, and vegetables).

Written by Randy Brooks, the song was originally performed by the husband-and-wife duo of [[Elmo Shropshire|Elmo]] and Patsy Trigg Shropshire in 1979.\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the lyrics, a [[Grandparent|grandmother]] is celebrating at a Christmas Eve party with her family when, while off her medication and [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]] on spiked [[eggnog]], she staggers outside into a [[Winter storm|snowstorm]] against the pleas of everyone in the room. She is found the next day, trampled; [[Santa Claus]] and his [[reindeer]] are determined to be the culprits when \"incriminating Claus marks\" are found on Grandma's back. The second and third verses describe the Christmas gathering where \"all the family's dressed in black\" to [[mourn]] her death and wonders if all the Christmas gifts they bought for her should be returned (the consensus is a firm yes). Christmas dinner otherwise goes on as normal, with a centerpiece of [[roast goose]], [[figgy pudding]] for dessert, and \"blue and silver candles\" to match Grandma's hairpiece; the newly widowed Grandpa seems completely unfazed by his wife's demise and spends the holiday \"[[Blue\u2013Gray Football Classic|watching football]], drinking beer and playing cards with Cousin Mel\" (who, while not stated as such in the lyrics, is an attractive and much younger woman in the music video and animated film). The [[Result|upshot]] is a warning to the listeners to beware, because \"a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves\" should never receive a driver's license.\n\nIn the music video, in which Elmo plays both Grandma and Grandpa while Patsy plays Cousin Mel, Grandma survives the attack and makes a triumphant return through the chimney.\n\n==Releases==\nAccording to Brooks, he played the song while sitting in with Elmo and Patsy at the Hyatt [[Lake Tahoe]] in December 1978, and after the show they had him make a cassette of the song for them to learn. A year later, they were selling 45s of the song from the stage, with Elmo himself appearing in drag on the album cover as \"Grandma\".\n\nThe song was originally self-released in [[San Francisco]] by the Shropshires in 1979 on their own record label (on \"Elmo 'n' Patsy\" #2984), with the B-side titled \"Christmas\". Initial copies appeared on a cream-colored label, with a sketch of a pig clearly visible, at left. Once initial copies had sold out, later-pressed #2984 cream-colored 45 label copies retained the same pig sketch, but decided to both move the sketch, and add the word \"Oink\", to the top of the 45's label. Meanwhile, the duo's names were moved to the bottom of the label, below the song title. By the early 1980s, the song was becoming a seasonal hit, first on [[country music|country stations]] and then on [[Contemporary Hit Radio|Top 40 stations]]. Oink Records, still based in [[Windsor, California]], continued distribution of the 45 rpm record in the western U.S., with \"Nationwide Sound Distributors\" (NSD) of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], pressing and distributing the song on its [[Soundwaves Records]] in the eastern U.S., peaking at #92 on the country singles charts. In 1982, the duo both re-recorded and re-released the song as a single, again as Oink #2984. But this time, Oink chose to handle all nationwide product distribution themselves, ending the old NSD-Soundwaves agreement. Re-recorded Oink #2984 45 copies appeared on a white label, not a cream-colored label, however. That is the easiest way (aside from listening to the 45 itself) to differentiate between the original 1979 Oink #2984 recording and its now-much-more familiar, 1982 re-recording. An entire LP, named after their hit song, was also recorded in 1982, and was initially released as Oink #8223. In 1984, with the song now a big hit nationally, [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] was interested in re-issuing both the 1982 Oink 45 re-recording, and the 1982 Oink LP. Soon after, [[Epic Records]] acquired the rights to both, from Elmo and Patsy. The Epic #04703 45 opted to replace the Oink 45's B-side, \"Christmas\", with a track from the LP, (\"Percy, the Puny [[Poinsettia]]\"). Epic's 1984 re-release of the 1982 Oink LP was a straight re-issue, on Epic #39931. By the end of 1984, it was reported that sales of \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" were, by record label: Oink: 50,000 45s sold; Soundwaves: 175,000 45s sold; Epic: 150,000 45s sold and 90,000 LPs sold. The Epic Records version charted at #64 on the country charts in 1998 and #48 in 1999.\n\nThe original version was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[Stiff Records]] (BUY 99) in 1980. It did not chart.\n\nOther releases by the original artist(s) would follow:\n\n*Following the Shropshires' divorce, Elmo re-recorded it solo in 1992 and again in 2000.\n*[[SonyBMG]] released ''Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'' by [[Dr. Elmo]] in 2002. The 2002 re-recording is distinguished by a slightly different opening note in the chorus melody.\n*[[Madacy]] Records released a ''Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'' gift tin (CD/DVD/Xmas stocking) by [[Dr. Elmo]] in 2007.\n*[[Time Life]] Records released ''Dr. Elmo's Bluegrass Christmas'' in 2010, which featured a bluegrass instrumental of \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\"\n\nA sequel, titled \"Grandpa's Gonna Sue the Pants Off of Santa\", in which Grandpa gets lawyers to fight Santa in court, was released by [[Elmo Shropshire]] on his album ''Dr. Elmo's Twisted Christmas'' (1992).\n\n==Covers==\nThe song has been recorded by other acts.\n\n*The first wide release of the song was in Canada in 1982 by [[The Irish Rovers]], released on the album, ''It Was a Night Like This''. Their signature version, produced by  [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]], rose to #20 on the RPM charts within a week of its release.<ref>{{cite news|last=RPM Album Charts|title=Adult Contemporary - Volume 37, No. 19, December 25, 1982|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.6164&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=1mqpiqom9hnjn6eoqg7oj1jd34|newspaper=Archives Canada|date=Dec 1982}}</ref>  The single became a seasonal hit, first on country stations, then on Top 40 stations, and today remains a 'seasonal holiday anthem'.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anningston|first=Brett|title= After four decades, group still loves to entertain|newspaper=Times & Transcript|date= Feb 25, 2010}}</ref> The song was also released on the Rovers' 1999 album ''Songs of Christmas''.\n*When the [[San Francisco 49ers]] earned a trip to [[Super Bowl XXIX]], Dr. Elmo released a parody, \"Chargers Got Run Over by the Niners\", predicting the 49ers' victory over their Super Bowl opponents, the [[L.A. Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] (the 49ers ended up winning the game 49-26). Most of the lyrics were actually spent making fun of the 49ers' main NFC rival, the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n*It has also been covered by [[Family Force 5]] (in the song, the word \"beer\" was edited out and replaced with root beer), and in 1996 by [[Ann Danielewski|Poe]].\n*It was also covered by [[Less Than Jake]] on their album ''[[Goodbye Blue and White]]''.\n*A rock cover version is on the album ''[[We Wish You a Metal Xmas and a Headbanging New Year]]''.\n*Country a cappella band [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] covered it on their 2014 Christmas album ''Full of Cheer''.\n*[[Reel Big Fish]] covered the song on their 2014 EP ''[[Happy Skalidays]]''.\n*[[Ray Stevens]] covered \"Grandma\" on Clyde Records in 2016.\n*Composer Brooks also has a version on the 2014 self-released ''Randy Brooks' Greatest Hit''.\n*Danish comedy band [[Linie 3]] released a Danish-language cover version of the song in 1984, with a slight change to the original lyrics.\n\n==Parodies==\nIn 1991 a [[Baltimore]] radio station targeted then [[Maryland Governor|Governor of Maryland]] [[William Shaefer]] with a parody entitled \"Shaefer Got Run Over by a Reindeer\".  Shaefer responded by posing for a marketing photo to help boost sales of the tape, the proceeds of which went to charity.<ref>https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1991-12-12-1991346015-story.html</ref>\n\nZ100 Portland Morning Zoo made a [[New Kids on the Block]]-bashing parody of the song for Christmas 1989, entitled \"New Kids Got Run Over by a Reindeer\".\n\nA parody \"Grandpa Got Run Over by a Beer Truck\" was released by [[Da Yoopers]] in 1993. Radio personality [[Bob Rivers]] recorded his own topical parody titled \"[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]] Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" on the 2002 ''[[White Trash Christmas]]'' album.\n\n[[Cledus T. Judd]] in 1996 released a parody called \"Grandpa Got Run Over by a [[John Deere]]\" as a sequel to \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" and as well did a cover of the song in 2002.\n\n[[Stan Boreson]] sings a Norwegian-American version, \"Lena Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" on his Christmas album, ''Stan Boreson Fractures Christmas''.\n\n[[2 Live Jews]] released a parody titled \"Moisha Got Run Over by a Wheelchair\" on their 1998 album ''Christmas Jews''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/2-Live-Jews-Christmas-Jews/release/5928164|title=2 Live Jews - Christmas Jews|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>\n\nOthers include \"Grandma Got Molested at the Airport\" by [[Donny Aldridge]], also sung by Dick Mango; and \"Grandma Got Dismembered by a Chainsaw\".\n\n==Popularity==\nEdison Media Research and Pinnacle Media Worldwide independently survey radio listeners on which Christmas songs they like and dislike.  In both surveys, results of which were reported in 2007, the only song that reached the top of both liked and disliked lists was \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\"<ref name=\"WashPost\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/13/AR2007121302192_pf.html|title=All I Want for Christmas Is Not To Hear That Song|first=Paul|last=Farhi|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 14, 2007}}</ref>  Its \"loved\" ratings in the Edison and Pinnacle polls were relatively high\u201447 and 32 percent, respectively\u2014but so were the \"hate\" or \"dislike\" ratings\u201417 and 22 percent.\n\nA major [[Washington, D.C.]] [[radio station]], WASH (97.1 FM), dropped the song from its [[playlist]]. \"It was too polarizing,\" says Bill Hess, [[program director]]. \"It wasn't strong, except with a few people, and it had a lot of negatives.\"<ref name=\"WashPost\"/> The song also gained notoriety at [[Davenport, Iowa]] radio station [[WLLR-FM|WLLR]] in 1985 when a disc jockey played the song 27 times back-to-back during the morning show before station management was able to stop him. The disc jockey, who was suspended, was reportedly depressed and upset that a co-worker had left employment at the station to work out-of-state.<ref>{{cite news |agency=[[United Press International]] |title=Dj's Record Effort Pulls Him Off Air |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=December 19, 1985 |access-date=December 23, 2017 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-19/news/8503280214_1_jack-daniels-station-listeners}}</ref>\n\nShropshire claims it is \"a beloved holiday favorite.\" The video of the song was \"a holiday staple on [[MTV]] for many seasons.\" It has been \"incorporated into talking toys and a musical greeting card.\" \"My royalties are four or five times what they were\" 20 years ago, claims Elmo, who performs the song with his [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group year-round.  \"A lot of younger people say it's not really Christmas until they hear it.\"<ref name=\"WashPost\"/>\n\n==Television==\nThe 2000 animated television program ''[[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer (film)|Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]'' portrays the events depicted in the song, though made for children; the cartoon is toned down a bit, so that Grandma survives. Moreover, Santa is actually innocent of the crime, which was instead masterminded by scheming relative Cousin Mel, who is mentioned briefly in the song but made into a gold-digging villainness in the special. Elmo Shropshire narrates the special and voices Grandpa. The special is a staple of [[Cartoon Network]]'s holiday programming and airs every holiday season on [[The CW]] (The special originally aired on the [[WB Network]] every holiday season until the 2006 merger with [[UPN]] to form The CW, where it continues to air today).\n\nIn the 2015 episode of the television show ''[[Scorpion_(TV_series)|Scorpion]]'', titled \"Dam Breakthrough\", three of the main characters sing part of this song, while inhaling helium.\n\nDuring [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]'s imagined funeral in ''[[JOLO (Family Guy)|#JOLO]]'' (episode 14, of [[Family Guy (season 13)|season 13]], of [[Family Guy]]), three small monkeys [[lip sync]] ''Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer''.\n\nIn the second season of the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[The Good Place]]'', the song is played on repeat (along with \"[[She Hates Me]]\" by [[Puddle of Mudd]]) at a party in the Bad Place attended by demons.\n\n==Music video==\nThe promotional music video for Elmo & Patsy's \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" was released in the mid-1980s, and aired on [[MTV]] for at least 18 years. The video could also be seen on [[VH1]], [[Country Music Television|CMT]], [[The Nashville Network|TNN]], [[Great American Country|GAC]], and [[VH1 Classic]] during the holiday season, as well as on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]'s official website and [[YouTube]]. Elmo Shropshire played Grandpa and Grandma while Patsy played Cousin Mel.\n\nWhile the family matriarch was run over by Santa Claus's reindeer, she has survived the accident (unlike in the actual song) and thus reappears toward the end of the video, alive and very much well, but somewhat fazed by the trampling. While being escorted inside the house by two policemen, she finally speaks the cautionary last line of the last verse as though commenting on Santa's driving: \"They should NEVER give a license/To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves\".\n\n==Chart performance==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"| Chart (1984)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n| US [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] (''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'')<ref name=\"whitburn1\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944\u20132008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2|authorlink=Joel Whitburn}}</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| 92\n|-\n!

Written by Randy Brooks, the song was originally performed by the husband-and-wife duo of [[Elmo Shropshire|Elmo]] and Patsy Trigg Shropshire in 1979.\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the lyrics, a [[Grandparent|grandmother]] is celebrating at a Christmas Eve party with her family when, while off her medication and [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]] on spiked [[eggnog]], she staggers outside into a [[Winter storm|snowstorm]] against the pleas of everyone in the room. She is found the next day, trampled; [[Santa Claus]] and his [[reindeer]] are determined to be the culprits when \"incriminating Claus marks\" are found on Grandma's back. The second and third verses describe the Christmas gathering where \"all the family's dressed in black\" to [[mourn]] her death and wonders if all the Christmas gifts they bought for her should be returned (the consensus is a firm yes). Christmas dinner otherwise goes on as normal, with a centerpiece of [[roast goose]], [[figgy pudding]] for dessert, and \"blue and silver candles\" to match Grandma's hairpiece; the newly widowed Grandpa seems completely unfazed by his wife's demise and spends the holiday \"[[Blue\u2013Gray Football Classic|watching football]], drinking beer and playing cards with Cousin Mel\" (who, while not stated as such in the lyrics, is an attractive and much younger woman in the music video and animated film). The [[Result|upshot]] is a warning to the listeners to beware, because \"a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves\" should never receive a driver's license.\n\nIn the music video, in which Elmo plays both Grandma and Grandpa while Patsy plays Cousin Mel, Grandma survives the attack and makes a triumphant return through the chimney.\n\n==Releases==\nAccording to Brooks, he played the song while sitting in with Elmo and Patsy at the Hyatt [[Lake Tahoe]] in December 1978, and after the show they had him make a cassette of the song for them to learn. A year later, they were selling 45s of the song from the stage, with Elmo himself appearing in drag on the album cover as \"Grandma\".\n\nThe song was originally self-released in [[San Francisco]] by the Shropshires in 1979 on their own record label (on \"Elmo 'n' Patsy\" #2984), with the B-side titled \"Christmas\". Initial copies appeared on a cream-colored label, with a sketch of a pig clearly visible, at left. Once initial copies had sold out, later-pressed #2984 cream-colored 45 label copies retained the same pig sketch, but decided to both move the sketch, and add the word \"Oink\", to the top of the 45's label. Meanwhile, the duo's names were moved to the bottom of the label, below the song title. By the early 1980s, the song was becoming a seasonal hit, first on [[country music|country stations]] and then on [[Contemporary Hit Radio|Top 40 stations]]. Oink Records, still based in [[Windsor, California]], continued distribution of the 45 rpm record in the western U.S., with \"Nationwide Sound Distributors\" (NSD) of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], pressing and distributing the song on its [[Soundwaves Records]] in the eastern U.S., peaking at #92 on the country singles charts. In 1982, the duo both re-recorded and re-released the song as a single, again as Oink #2984. But this time, Oink chose to handle all nationwide product distribution themselves, ending the old NSD-Soundwaves agreement. Re-recorded Oink #2984 45 copies appeared on a white label, not a cream-colored label, however. That is the easiest way (aside from listening to the 45 itself) to differentiate between the original 1979 Oink #2984 recording and its now-much-more familiar, 1982 re-recording. An entire LP, named after their hit song, was also recorded in 1982, and was initially released as Oink #8223. In 1984, with the song now a big hit nationally, [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] was interested in re-issuing both the 1982 Oink 45 re-recording, and the 1982 Oink LP. Soon after, [[Epic Records]] acquired the rights to both, from Elmo and Patsy. The Epic #04703 45 opted to replace the Oink 45's B-side, \"Christmas\", with a track from the LP, (\"Percy, the Puny [[Poinsettia]]\"). Epic's 1984 re-release of the 1982 Oink LP was a straight re-issue, on Epic #39931. By the end of 1984, it was reported that sales of \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" were, by record label: Oink: 50,000 45s sold; Soundwaves: 175,000 45s sold; Epic: 150,000 45s sold and 90,000 LPs sold. The Epic Records version charted at #64 on the country charts in 1998 and #48 in 1999.\n\nThe original version was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[Stiff Records]] (BUY 99) in 1980. It did not chart.\n\nOther releases by the original artist(s) would follow:\n\n*Following the Shropshires' divorce, Elmo re-recorded it solo in 1992 and again in 2000.\n*[[SonyBMG]] released ''Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'' by [[Dr. Elmo]] in 2002. The 2002 re-recording is distinguished by a slightly different opening note in the chorus melody.\n*[[Madacy]] Records released a ''Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'' gift tin (CD/DVD/Xmas stocking) by [[Dr. Elmo]] in 2007.\n*[[Time Life]] Records released ''Dr. Elmo's Bluegrass Christmas'' in 2010, which featured a bluegrass instrumental of \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\"\n\nA sequel, titled \"Grandpa's Gonna Sue the Pants Off of Santa\", in which Grandpa gets lawyers to fight Santa in court, was released by [[Elmo Shropshire]] on his album ''Dr. Elmo's Twisted Christmas'' (1992).\n\n==Covers==\nThe song has been recorded by other acts.\n\n*The first wide release of the song was in Canada in 1982 by [[The Irish Rovers]], released on the album, ''It Was a Night Like This''. Their signature version, produced by  [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]], rose to #20 on the RPM charts within a week of its release.<ref>{{cite news|last=RPM Album Charts|title=Adult Contemporary - Volume 37, No. 19, December 25, 1982|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.6164&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=1mqpiqom9hnjn6eoqg7oj1jd34|newspaper=Archives Canada|date=Dec 1982}}</ref>  The single became a seasonal hit, first on country stations, then on Top 40 stations, and today remains a 'seasonal holiday anthem'.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anningston|first=Brett|title= After four decades, group still loves to entertain|newspaper=Times & Transcript|date= Feb 25, 2010}}</ref> The song was also released on the Rovers' 1999 album ''Songs of Christmas''.\n*When the [[San Francisco 49ers]] earned a trip to [[Super Bowl XXIX]], Dr. Elmo released a parody, \"Chargers Got Run Over by the Niners\", predicting the 49ers' victory over their Super Bowl opponents, the [[L.A. Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] (the 49ers ended up winning the game 49-26). Most of the lyrics were actually spent making fun of the 49ers' main NFC rival, the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n*It has also been covered by [[Family Force 5]] (in the song, the word \"beer\" was edited out and replaced with root beer), and in 1996 by [[Ann Danielewski|Poe]].\n*It was also covered by [[Less Than Jake]] on their album ''[[Goodbye Blue and White]]''.\n*A rock cover version is on the album ''[[We Wish You a Metal Xmas and a Headbanging New Year]]''.\n*Country a cappella band [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] covered it on their 2014 Christmas album ''Full of Cheer''.\n*[[Reel Big Fish]] covered the song on their 2014 EP ''[[Happy Skalidays]]''.\n*[[Ray Stevens]] covered \"Grandma\" on Clyde Records in 2016.\n*Composer Brooks also has a version on the 2014 self-released ''Randy Brooks' Greatest Hit''.\n*Danish comedy band [[Linie 3]] released a Danish-language cover version of the song in 1984, with a slight change to the original lyrics.\n\n==Parodies==\nIn 1991 a [[Baltimore]] radio station targeted then [[Maryland Governor|Governor of Maryland]] [[William Shaefer]] with a parody entitled \"Shaefer Got Run Over by a Reindeer\".  Shaefer responded by posing for a marketing photo to help boost sales of the tape, the proceeds of which went to charity.<ref>https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1991-12-12-1991346015-story.html</ref>\n\nZ100 Portland Morning Zoo made a [[New Kids on the Block]]-bashing parody of the song for Christmas 1989, entitled \"New Kids Got Run Over by a Reindeer\".\n\nA parody \"Grandpa Got Run Over by a Beer Truck\" was released by [[Da Yoopers]] in 1993. Radio personality [[Bob Rivers]] recorded his own topical parody titled \"[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]] Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" on the 2002 ''[[White Trash Christmas]]'' album.\n\n[[Cledus T. Judd]] in 1996 released a parody called \"Grandpa Got Run Over by a [[John Deere]]\" as a sequel to \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" and as well did a cover of the song in 2002.\n\n[[Stan Boreson]] sings a Norwegian-American version, \"Lena Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" on his Christmas album, ''Stan Boreson Fractures Christmas''.\n\n[[2 Live Jews]] released a parody titled \"Moisha Got Run Over by a Wheelchair\" on their 1998 album ''Christmas Jews''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/2-Live-Jews-Christmas-Jews/release/5928164|title=2 Live Jews - Christmas Jews|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>\n\nOthers include \"Grandma Got Molested at the Airport\" by [[Donny Aldridge]], also sung by Dick Mango; and \"Grandma Got Dismembered by a Chainsaw\".\n\n==Popularity==\nEdison Media Research and Pinnacle Media Worldwide independently survey radio listeners on which Christmas songs they like and dislike.  In both surveys, results of which were reported in 2007, the only song that reached the top of both liked and disliked lists was \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\"<ref name=\"WashPost\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/13/AR2007121302192_pf.html|title=All I Want for Christmas Is Not To Hear That Song|first=Paul|last=Farhi|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 14, 2007}}</ref>  Its \"loved\" ratings in the Edison and Pinnacle polls were relatively high\u201447 and 32 percent, respectively\u2014but so were the \"hate\" or \"dislike\" ratings\u201417 and 22 percent.\n\nA major [[Washington, D.C.]] [[radio station]], WASH (97.1 FM), dropped the song from its [[playlist]]. \"It was too polarizing,\" says Bill Hess, [[program director]]. \"It wasn't strong, except with a few people, and it had a lot of negatives.\"<ref name=\"WashPost\"/> The song also gained notoriety at [[Davenport, Iowa]] radio station [[WLLR-FM|WLLR]] in 1985 when a disc jockey played the song 27 times back-to-back during the morning show before station management was able to stop him. The disc jockey, who was suspended, was reportedly depressed and upset that a co-worker had left employment at the station to work out-of-state.<ref>{{cite news |agency=[[United Press International]] |title=Dj's Record Effort Pulls Him Off Air |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=December 19, 1985 |access-date=December 23, 2017 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-19/news/8503280214_1_jack-daniels-station-listeners}}</ref>\n\nShropshire claims it is \"a beloved holiday favorite.\" The video of the song was \"a holiday staple on [[MTV]] for many seasons.\" It has been \"incorporated into talking toys and a musical greeting card.\" \"My royalties are four or five times what they were\" 20 years ago, claims Elmo, who performs the song with his [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group year-round.  \"A lot of younger people say it's not really Christmas until they hear it.\"<ref name=\"WashPost\"/>\n\n==Television==\nThe 2000 animated television program ''[[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer (film)|Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]'' portrays the events depicted in the song, though made for children; the cartoon is toned down a bit, so that Grandma survives. Moreover, Santa is actually innocent of the crime, which was instead masterminded by scheming relative Cousin Mel, who is mentioned briefly in the song but made into a gold-digging villainness in the special. Elmo Shropshire narrates the special and voices Grandpa. The special is a staple of [[Cartoon Network]]'s holiday programming and airs every holiday season on [[The CW]] (The special originally aired on the [[WB Network]] every holiday season until the 2006 merger with [[UPN]] to form The CW, where it continues to air today).\n\nIn the 2015 episode of the television show ''[[Scorpion_(TV_series)|Scorpion]]'', titled \"Dam Breakthrough\", three of the main characters sing part of this song, while inhaling helium.\n\nDuring [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]'s imagined funeral in ''[[JOLO (Family Guy)|#JOLO]]'' (episode 14, of [[Family Guy (season 13)|season 13]], of [[Family Guy]]), three small monkeys [[lip sync]] ''Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer''.\n\nIn the second season of the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[The Good Place]]'', the song is played on repeat (along with \"[[She Hates Me]]\" by [[Puddle of Mudd]]) at a party in the Bad Place attended by demons.\n\n==Music video==\nThe promotional music video for Elmo & Patsy's \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" was released in the mid-1980s, and aired on [[MTV]] for at least 18 years. The video could also be seen on [[VH1]], [[Country Music Television|CMT]], [[The Nashville Network|TNN]], [[Great American Country|GAC]], and [[VH1 Classic]] during the holiday season, as well as on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]'s official website and [[YouTube]]. Elmo Shropshire played Grandpa and Grandma while Patsy played Cousin Mel.\n\nWhile the family matriarch was run over by Santa Claus's reindeer, she has survived the accident (unlike in the actual song) and thus reappears toward the end of the video, alive and very much well, but somewhat fazed by the trampling. While being escorted inside the house by two policemen, she finally speaks the cautionary last line of the last verse as though commenting on Santa's driving: \"They should NEVER give a license/To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves\".\n\n==Chart performance==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"| Chart (1984)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n| US [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] (''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'')<ref name=\"whitburn1\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944\u20132008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2|authorlink=Joel Whitburn}}</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| 92\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|Chart (1992)\n! align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n| US [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] (''Billboard'')<ref name=\"whitburn2\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Top Pop Singles 1955\u20132010|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2011|isbn=978-0-89820-188-8|authorlink=Joel Whitburn}}</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| 12\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|Chart (1997\u20131998)\n! align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n| US Hot Country Singles & Tracks (''Billboard'')<ref name=\"whitburn1\"/>\n| align=\"center\"| 64\n|-\n| US ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref name=\"whitburn2\"/>\n| align=\"center\"| 87\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|Chart (1999\u20132000)\n! align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n| US Hot Country Singles & Tracks (''Billboard'')<ref name=\"whitburn1\"/>\n| align=\"center\"| 48\n|}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Lisi |work=[[The Daily Gazette]] |title=The novelty never wears off for some clever songs written for the season |page=G01 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SDGB&p_theme=sdgb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1110FC8626A399A9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |date=December 10, 2000 |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*\n*[http://www.billboard.com/articles/chartbeat/1481537/weekly-chart-notes-dr-elmos-grandma-gets-her-revenge 2012 Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer #1 on the billboard charts - 1st time in 27 years.]\n*{{YouTube|OHz0T3aSLFU|2009/2010 Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer promotion on TV and radio}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206013150/http://www.theballadeers.com/IR_D23_night_like_this.htm 2001 The Balladeers, It Was A Night Like This]\n*[http://www.drelmo.com/albums.html Dr. Elmo/Grandma Official WebSite]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204045834/http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/grannies-learn-to-love-grandma-got-run-over-by-a-reindeer/19726026 Grannies Learn to Love 'Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer' Monica Garske AOL NEWS]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204072554/http://www.radio-info.com/programming/country/grandma-singer-dr-elmo-is-having-the-last-laugh 2010 article by Phyllis Stark]\n*[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2408 Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer Songfacts]\n*[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20121204/ARTICLES/121209833?p=2&tc=pg 2012 Novelty reindeer song still has legs]\n*[http://frontporchexpressions.com/2013/12/19/singers-persistence-turns-reindeer-song-into-bestseller/ 2013 Singer\u2019s persistence turns reindeer song into bestseller ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115919/http://www.csnbayarea.com/show/391546/episode/657736 2013 Dr. Elmo on Comcast/Yahoo Sports Network]\n*{{YouTube|TfSb6J4jhcU|A Remix of the original song \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\" Produced and performed by Dr. Elmo, Written by Randy Brooks, re-mixed by Frank Martin.}}\n*{{YouTube|Zlywn0D1eIw|2016 Interview with Randy Brooks and his famous song}}\n\n[[Category:Black comedy music]]\n[[Category:Comedy songs]]\n[[Category:Christmas novelty songs]]\n[[Category:American Christmas songs]]\n[[Category:1979 songs]]\n[[Category:Epic Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs about old age]]\n[[Category:Songs about death]]\n[[Category:Songs about animals]]\n", "name_user": "JordanPowers95", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(addedCategory:Novelty songsusingHotCat)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandma_Got_Run_Over_by_a_Reindeer"}
