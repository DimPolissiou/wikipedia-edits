Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historical validity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism. This further amplified the idea of him being the primary heir and eldest son of the Buddha, which came to be symbolized by the robe Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had received.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in a next age. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha with the next Buddha Maitreya, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a separate section. In the P\u0101li tradition, this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

However, in the accounts about the First Council, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa appears very prominent, whereas \u0100nanda is humbled and given far less credit.

These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition:{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Findly |1992 |pages=253}}.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported about a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historical validity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism. This further amplified the idea of him being the primary heir and eldest son of the Buddha, which came to be symbolized by the robe Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had received.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called  [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in a next age. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha with the next Buddha Maitreya, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a separate section. In the P\u0101li tradition, this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported about a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s.

Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.

Chemists, he noted, will read the word \"unionized\" as ''un''-''ion-ized'' (pronounced \"un-EYE-en-ized\"), meaning \"(a chemical species) being in an electrically neutral state, as opposed to being an ion\", while non-chemists will read the word as ''union-ized'' (pronounced \"YOU-nien-ized\"), meaning \"(a worker or organization) belonging to or possessing a trade union\".\n\n=== Coined terms ===\nAsimov coined the term \"[[robotics]]\" in his 1941 story \"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\",<ref>According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' the term \"robotics\" was first used in the short story \"Liar!\" published in the May 1941 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction''.</ref> though he later remarked that he believed then that he was merely using an existing word, as he stated in ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"The Robot Chronicles\"). While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager <!-- was Eos --> |date=1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented ... the word|title-link=Counting the Eons }}</ref>\n\nIn the same story, Asimov also coined the term \"positronic\" (the counterpart to \"electronic\" for [[positron]]s).<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/positronic Oxford Dictionary website] entry for \"positronic\"</ref>\n\nAsimov coined the term \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 [[fix-up]] novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out. For months and months I lived and thought Shakespeare, and I don't see how there can be any greater pleasure in the world\u2014any pleasure, that is, that one can indulge in for as much as ten hours without pause, day after day indefinitely.\"}} ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''[[The Sensuous Dirty Old Man]]'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as [[sexual harassment]] and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dont-look-away-fighting-sexual-harassment-in-the-scifi-1785704207|title=Don't Look Away: Fighting Sexual Harassment in the Scifi/Fantasy Community|last=Hines|first=Jim C.|date=August 29, 2016|work=io9|access-date=December 18, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAsimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]].

In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors.

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=The Tragedy of the Moon |pages=48\u201358 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |date=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3|title-link=The Tragedy of the Moon }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nAsimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.<ref name=SFAwards>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html#179 \"Asimov, Isaac\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016200502/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html |date=October 16, 2012 }}.

I'll write as I please and let the critics do the analyzing.|Asimov, 1973{{r|asimov1973}}}}\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nAsimov was his own secretary, typist, [[index (publishing)|index]]er, [[proofreader]], and [[literary agent]].{{r|nichols19690803}} He wrote a typed first draft composed at the keyboard at 90 words per minute; he imagined an ending first, then a beginning, then \"let everything in-between work itself out as I come to it\". (Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Joseph Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

During his childhood, his father and mother observed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] traditions, though not as stringently as they had in Petrovichi; they did not, however, force their beliefs upon young Isaac. Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=11\u201314}}</ref> When he was 13, he chose not to have a [[bar mitzvah]].<ref>''In Memory Yet Green'', p. 121</ref> As his books ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' and ''Asimov Laughs Again'' record, Asimov was willing to tell jokes involving God, [[Satan]], the [[Garden of Eden]], [[Jerusalem]], and other religious topics, expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\"/><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\"/>\n\nFor a brief while, his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and, as Isaac put it, \"shine as a learned scholar\"<ref>Asimov, Isaac. ''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

Then too, it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion.<ref>{{cite book |first=Isaac |last=Asimov |title=Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection |year=1995 |pages=297\u2013302}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Politics ===\nAsimov became a staunch supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the [[New Deal]], and thereafter remained a political [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. Asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: \"I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal. To my way of thinking, the ordeal was necessary to make certain it would never happen again.\"<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Doubleday, 1980) chapter 39</ref>\n\nAfter Asimov's name appeared in the mid-1960s on a list of people the [[Communist Party USA]] \"considered amenable\" to its goals, the [[FBI]] investigated him. Because of his academic background, the bureau briefly considered Asimov as a possible candidate for known Soviet spy ROBPROF, but found nothing suspicious in his life or background.<ref name=\"skelding20131107\">{{cite web |url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/nov/07/isaac-asimov-fbi-file-ROBPROF/ |title=\"Inimical to the best interests of the United States.\" Isaac Asimov's FBI File |last=Skelding |first=Conor |website=MuckRock |date=November 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThough from a Jewish family, Asimov appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards [[Israel]]. In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

Actually, I feel that no human group deserves a \"homeland\" in the usual sense of the word. ... I am not a Zionist, then, because I don't believe in nations, and Zionism merely sets up one more nation to trouble the world.}}}}\n\n=== Social issues ===\nAsimov believed that \"''science'' fiction ... serve[s] the good of humanity\".{{r|asimov196708}} He considered himself a feminist even before [[women's liberation]] became a widespread movement; he argued that the issue of [[women's rights]] was closely connected to that of population control.<ref name=\"YIA\" /> Furthermore, he believed that [[homosexuality]] must be considered a \"moral right\" on population grounds, as must all consenting adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction.<ref name=\"YIA\" /> He issued many appeals for [[population control]], reflecting a perspective articulated by people from [[Thomas Malthus]] through [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part I |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf |work=transcript page 6, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1988 interview by [[Bill Moyers]], Asimov proposed [[computer-aided learning]], where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part II |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov2.pdf |work=transcript page 3, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref> He thought this would make learning more interesting, since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn, and would help spread knowledge around the world.

In a letter reprinted in ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'',<ref name=\"YIA\">Asimov, Isaac (1996). ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it.

R. R. Tolkien]], using ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as a plot point in a [[Black Widowers]] story.<ref name=\"asimov1976\">{{Cite book|title=More Tales of the Black Widowers |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1976 |isbn=0-385-11176-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/moretalesofblack00asim/page/62 62\u201376] |chapter=Nothing Like Murder |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/moretalesofblack00asim#page/62/mode/2up |url=https://archive.org/details/moretalesofblack00asim/page/62 }}</ref> (Tolkien said that he enjoyed Asimov's science fiction.<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|No. 294}}</ref>) He acknowledged other writers as superior to himself in talent, saying of [[Harlan Ellison]], \"He is (in my opinion) one of the best writers in the world, far more skilled at the art than I am.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' p. 246</ref> Asimov disapproved of the [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]]'s growing influence, however, stating in 1967 \"I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 379</ref> He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to be \"a slapdash and sloppy writer.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 391</ref>\n\nAsimov also enjoyed humorous stories, particularly those of [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>Asimov (1979) ''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 90</ref>\n\nIn non-fiction writing, Asimov particularly admired the writing style of [[Martin Gardner]], and tried to emulate it in his own science books. On meeting Gardner for the first time in 1965, Asimov told him this, to which Gardner answered that he had based his own style on Asimov's.<ref>Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1980) p. 369</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n[[Paul Krugman]], holder of a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]], has stated Asimov's concept of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] inspired him to become an economist.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/who-are-you-calling-dense/ |title=The Conscience of a Liberal, 'Who Are You Calling Dense?' |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohn Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed, \"It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/NonAsimov/White.html |title=Review of an Asimov biography, 'The Unauthorized Life' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> Along with such figures as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Karl Popper]], Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinarians]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|title=Ten Cheers for Interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/10CHEERS.HTM|journal=Social Science Journal |date=1997 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=201\u2013216 |doi=10.1016/s0362-3319(97)90051-3}}</ref> \"Few individuals\", writes [[Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|James L.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAsimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] except for category 100, [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\" /> Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology,<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/Essays/psychology.html |title=Asimov essays about psychology |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=1995 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref> and forewords for the books ''The Humanist Way'' (1988) and ''In Pursuit of Truth'' (1982),<ref name=\"Popper\" /> which were classified in the 100s category, none of his own books were classified in that category.<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others11 |title=Did you know that Asimov is the only author to have published books in all ten categories of the Dewey Decimal System? |date=2014 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Index Translationum database'', Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.<ref>''[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&nTyp=min&topN=50 Index Translationum database]''</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager <!-- was Eos --> |date=1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented ... the word|title-link=Counting the Eons }}</ref>\n\nIn the same story, Asimov also coined the term \"positronic\" (the counterpart to \"electronic\" for [[positron]]s).<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/positronic Oxford Dictionary website] entry for \"positronic\"</ref>\n\nAsimov coined the term \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 [[fix-up]] novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out. For months and months I lived and thought Shakespeare, and I don't see how there can be any greater pleasure in the world\u2014any pleasure, that is, that one can indulge in for as much as ten hours without pause, day after day indefinitely.\"}} ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''[[The Sensuous Dirty Old Man]]'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as [[sexual harassment]] and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dont-look-away-fighting-sexual-harassment-in-the-scifi-1785704207|title=Don't Look Away: Fighting Sexual Harassment in the Scifi/Fantasy Community|last=Hines|first=Jim C.|date=August 29, 2016|work=io9|access-date=December 18, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAsimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]].

The epilogue was written by his widow [[Janet Asimov]] after his death.

In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors. The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author.<ref>{{cite book|title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |last=Asimov |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Asimov |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |date=1987 |publisher=Walker & Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-8027-0945-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/howtoenjoywritin00asim_0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book362.html |title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |publisher=John H.

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=The Tragedy of the Moon |pages=48\u201358 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |date=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3|title-link=The Tragedy of the Moon }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nAsimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.<ref name=SFAwards>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html#179 \"Asimov, Isaac\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016200502/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html |date=October 16, 2012 }}.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. Asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: \"I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

Asimov: A Memoir'' p. 246</ref> Asimov disapproved of the [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]]'s growing influence, however, stating in 1967 \"I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 379</ref> He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to be \"a slapdash and sloppy writer.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 391</ref>\n\nAsimov also enjoyed humorous stories, particularly those of [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>Asimov (1979) ''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 90</ref>\n\nIn non-fiction writing, Asimov particularly admired the writing style of [[Martin Gardner]], and tried to emulate it in his own science books. On meeting Gardner for the first time in 1965, Asimov told him this, to which Gardner answered that he had based his own style on Asimov's.<ref>Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1980) p. 369</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n[[Paul Krugman]], holder of a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]], has stated Asimov's concept of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] inspired him to become an economist.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/who-are-you-calling-dense/ |title=The Conscience of a Liberal, 'Who Are You Calling Dense?' |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohn Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed, \"It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/NonAsimov/White.html |title=Review of an Asimov biography, 'The Unauthorized Life' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> Along with such figures as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Karl Popper]], Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinarians]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|title=Ten Cheers for Interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/10CHEERS.HTM|journal=Social Science Journal |date=1997 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=201\u2013216 |doi=10.1016/s0362-3319(97)90051-3}}</ref> \"Few individuals\", writes [[Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|James L.

First admirals were mentioned in 14th century as commanders of the royal fleet of Croatian-Hungarian king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. Officers from today's Croatia served in various navies in control of Croatia or its parts. For instance, [[Jusuf Ma\u0161kovi\u0107]] served as a [[Kapudan Pasha|grand admiral]] of Ottoman Navy in 1630s, just like [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] in 1530s; [[Ivan of Vrana]] was a Venetian admiral in late 16th century, taking part in the [[Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u010corali\u0107|first=Lovorka|last2=Prijatelj Pavi\u010di\u0107|first2=Ivana|date=2005-12-01|title=Ivan iz Vrane \u2013 mleta\u010dki admiral u Lepantskom boju (1571.)|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/12728|journal=Povijesni prilozi|language=hr|volume=24|issue=29|pages=127\u2013149|issn=0351-9767}}</ref> Croatian personnel served in the [[Venetian navy|Venetian Navy]] until its demise in 1797 and, in modern times, in Habsburg/[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as Croatia was a constituent part of the monarchy (until 1918). First Croatian admirals distinguished themselves commanding Habsburg ships in [[First Italian War of Independence]] in 1848.\n\nCroatian admirals helped lead Austro-Hungarian Navy through [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]] and later oversaw the creation and development of [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the interwar years (1918-1941). In World War II they found themselves on opposing sides, as some chose to collaborate and joined rather limited Navy of Independent State of Croatia (1941\u201345), while others founded guerilla [[Yugoslav Partisans#Partisan Navy|Partisan Navy]], which liberated the Croatian Adriatic and later developed into [[Yugoslav Navy]] (1942\u201391). Croatian admirals led Yugoslav Navy during the Cold War, overseeing its development of submarines and strengthening its capacities. After 1991, breaking off from Yugoslav Navy, Croatian admirals steered Croatian Navy through the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from Yugoslavia (1991-5).\n\nWhat follows is a list of naval officers '''from the territory of today's Republic of Croatia'''. For a list of admirals of the modern, post-1991 [[Croatian Navy]], see [[List of Croatian Navy admirals]]. [[Croats of Boka Kotorska|Historical Croat community in Boka Kotorska]] has produced a long line of admirals (Russian Grand admiral [[Matija Zmajevi\u0107]], Austrian vice-admiral [https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Bujacovich,_Alexander_Freiherr Aleksandar Bujakovi\u0107] (1792-1870) etc.), but these are excluded from this list.\n\n==Admiral flote==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horisontal\n| image1   = Zastava admirala flote OS RH.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>1991\u2013</small></center>\n| width1     = 70\n| image2   = SFR Yugoslavia Fleet Admiral.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>1956-91?\u2013</small></center>\n| width2     = 70\n| header    = <center>Rank Flag</center>\n| footer    = <center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''Admiral Flote'''</span></center>\n| footer_background = #007\n}}\n\nIn Yugoslav Navy, [[Branko Mamula]] was promoted to the rank of the Admiral of the Fleet in 1983. In [[Croatian Navy]], rank of Fleet Admiral was introduced in 1995 as the naval equivalent to the [[five-star rank]] of the  [[OF-10]].

First admirals were mentioned in 14th century as commanders of the royal fleet of Croatian-Hungarian king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. Officers from today's Croatia served in various navies in control of Croatia or its parts. For instance, [[Jusuf Ma\u0161kovi\u0107]] served as a [[Kapudan Pasha|grand admiral]] of Ottoman Navy in 1630s, just like [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] in 1530s; [[Ivan of Vrana]] was a Venetian admiral in late 16th century, taking part in the [[Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u010corali\u0107|first=Lovorka|last2=Prijatelj Pavi\u010di\u0107|first2=Ivana|date=2005-12-01|title=Ivan iz Vrane \u2013 mleta\u010dki admiral u Lepantskom boju (1571.)|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/12728|journal=Povijesni prilozi|language=hr|volume=24|issue=29|pages=127\u2013149|issn=0351-9767}}</ref> Croatian personnel served in the [[Venetian navy|Venetian Navy]] until its demise in 1797 and, in modern times, in Habsburg/[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as Croatia was a constituent part of the monarchy (until 1918). First Croatian admirals distinguished themselves commanding Habsburg ships in [[First Italian War of Independence]] in 1848.\n\nCroatian admirals helped lead Austro-Hungarian Navy through [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]] and later oversaw the creation and development of [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the interwar years (1918-1941). In World War II they found themselves on opposing sides, as some chose to collaborate and joined rather limited Navy of Independent State of Croatia (1941\u201345), while others founded guerilla [[Yugoslav Partisans#Partisan Navy|Partisan Navy]], which liberated the Croatian Adriatic and later developed into [[Yugoslav Navy]] (1942\u201391). Croatian admirals led Yugoslav Navy during the Cold War, overseeing its development of submarines and strengthening its capacities. After 1991, breaking off from Yugoslav Navy, Croatian admirals steered Croatian Navy through the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from Yugoslavia (1991-5).\n\nWhat follows is a list of naval officers '''from the territory of today's Republic of Croatia'''. For a list of admirals of the modern, post-1991 [[Croatian Navy]], see [[List of Croatian Navy admirals]]. [[Croats of Boka Kotorska|Historical Croat community in Boka Kotorska]] has produced a long line of admirals (Russian Grand admiral [[Matija Zmajevi\u0107]], Austrian vice-admiral [https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Bujacovich,_Alexander_Freiherr Aleksandar Bujakovi\u0107] (1792-1870) etc.), but these are excluded from this list.\n\n==Admiral flote==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horisontal\n| image1   = Zastava admirala flote OS RH.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>1991\u2013</small></center>\n| width1     = 70\n| image2   = SFR Yugoslavia Fleet Admiral.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>1956-91?\u2013</small></center>\n| width2     = 70\n| header    = <center>Rank Flag</center>\n| footer    = <center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''Admiral Flote'''</span></center>\n| footer_background = #007\n}}\n\nIn Yugoslav Navy, [[Branko Mamula]] was promoted to the rank of the Admiral of the Fleet in 1983. In [[Croatian Navy]], rank of Fleet Admiral was introduced in 1995 as the naval equivalent to the [[five-star rank]] of the  [[OF-10]]. Commending him on his role as the commander of Croatian Navy during the [[Croatian War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1991-5), president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man|Tu\u0111man]] conferred the rank on admiral Letica. ''[[Sveto Letica|Sveto Letica-Barba]]'' was the first and so far the only Croatian [[flag officer]] to hold this rank.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Below is a list of flood events that were of significant impact to California\n\n==1800\u20131899==\n=== Los Angeles flood of 1825 ===\nChanged the course of the [[Los Angeles River]] from its western outlet into [[Santa Monica Bay]] following the course of [[Ballona Creek]] to a southern outlet at [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]] near where it is today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYpMOjasoqYC|title=Whitewashed Adobe: The Rise of Los Angeles and the Remaking of Its Mexican Past|first=William F.|last=Deverell|date=June 3, 2004|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===January 1850===\nIn January 1850, a major flood devastated the new city of [[Sacramento]]; rain from heavy storms saturated the grounds upon which Sacramento was built, and the [[American River|American]] and [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] rivers crested simultaneously.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/sacramentoillust00seve|url-access=registration|title=Sacramento: an illustrated history: 1839 to 1874, from Sutter's Fort to Capital City|first=Thor|last=Severson|date=July 26, 1973|publisher=California Historical Society|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n===Years closely following January 1850===\nMany floods occurred later in the city of Sacramento and other low lying cities along the Sierra born rivers due to hydraulic mining at locations in the foothills, for example [[Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park|Malakoff Diggins]] in which sludge runoffs purportedly raised the river beds in the valley below, an additional two feet. Hydraulic Gold mining became a hot topic for the time and was eventually stopped by California Lawmakers.\n\n===October 1858: Schooner-beaching storm surge in San Diego===\n{{Main|1858 San Diego hurricane}}\n\n===December 1861 \u2013 January 1862: California's Great Flood===\n{{main|Great Flood of 1862}}\nBeginning on December 24, 1861, and lasting for 45 days, the largest flood in California's recorded history occurred, reaching full flood stage in different areas between January 9\u201312, 1862.  The entire [[Sacramento Valley|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin Valley|San Joaquin]] valleys were inundated for an extent of {{convert|300|mi|km}}, averaging {{convert|20|mi|km}} in breadth. State government was forced to relocate from the capital in Sacramento for 18 months in San Francisco. The rain created an inland sea in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], lasting about three weeks with water standing {{convert|4|ft|m}} deep up to {{convert|4|mi|0}} from the river.<ref name=\"CAFLOODS\" />\nThe Los Angeles basin was flooded from the San Gabriel Mountains to the Palos Verdes Peninsula, at variable depths, excluding the higher lands which became islands until the waters receded. The Los Angeles basin lost 200,000 cattle by way of drowning, as well as homes, ranches, farm crops & vineyards being swept-away.\n\n==1900\u20131949==\n===1909: California flood===\nThe storm extended from [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] on the coast to the [[Feather River]] [[drainage basin|basin]]. [[La Porte, California|La Porte]], in the Feather River basin, had {{convert|57.41|in|mm}} of rain in 20 days, an event with a return period of 12,000 years. The flood episodes of 1907 and 1909 in California resulted in an overhaul of planned statewide flood control designs.<ref name=\"CAFLOODS\" />\n\n===December 1933 \u2013 January 1934: Crescenta Valley flood===\n{{main|La Crescenta-Montrose, California#The Great Flood of 1934}}\nIn the last week of December 1933, {{convert|12|in}} of rain fell in the communities of [[La Crescenta-Montrose, California|La Crescenta]], [[La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, California|La Ca\u00f1ada]] and [[La Crescenta-Montrose, California|Montrose]] just north of Los Angeles.  On New Year's Eve, more rain fell.  The result was a flood of mud and water that began around midnight, destroying more than 400 homes in this area.  This was commemorated in [[Woody Guthrie]]'s song \"Los Angeles New Year's Flood\".  As a result of this flood, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[Los Angeles County, California|County of Los Angeles]] built a [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Works|flood control system]] of catch basins and concrete storm drains to prevent a repeat of the disaster.\n\n===February 1937: Santa Ana flood===\nThe storm of February 4\u20137, 1937 resulted in the highest four-day rainfall totals at several stations in the [[Santa Ana River]] basin. The [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] North station had over {{convert|8|in}} of rain in that four days, which equaled a 450-year event. Other stations also received high amounts of rain within those four days.<ref name=\"CAFLOODS\" />\n\n===December 1937: Northeast California flood===\nThe storm of December 1937 was a high-elevation event in the northeast corner of the state.<ref name=\"CAFLOODS\" />\n\n===Los Angeles Flood of 1938===\nTwo significant cyclones moved through the region; one between February 27 and March 1 and the second between March 1 and March 3. Over {{convert|254|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain had fallen during the five-day period. Massive debris flows moved out from the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] into the [[Los Angeles Basin]]. Although [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] experienced damage, [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange]] counties bore the brunt of the flooding. A total of 5601 homes were destroyed, and an additional 1500 homes were left uninhabitable. The three transcontinental railroads connecting Los Angeles to the outside world experienced washed out bridges and flooded lines, isolating the city. Mail service after the flood was conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard. The death toll was 115. It was the region's worst flood since New Year's Day of 1934. The result of this flood was the Flood Control Act of 1941, which authorized the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] to build a series of concrete sewers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.semp.us/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231093732/http://semp.us/biots/biot_369.html|url-status=dead|title=SEMP \u2013 Evidence based disaster management.|archivedate=December 31, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===September 1939: Los Angeles River===\n{{Main|1939 California tropical storm}}\n\n==1950 \u2013 1999==\n===November 1950: California flood===\nA statewide disaster was declared November 21 when floods caused 9 deaths and $32 million in damage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yolo County Disasters Since 1950|url=http://www.yolocounty.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=13428|work=Yolo Operational Area Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan|accessdate=29 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718174052/http://www.yolocounty.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=13428|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===December 1955: California flood===\nThe storm affected the central [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra]] and [[South Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|South Bay]] areas.

The season started on August 15, 1993, and its final round (40th) was played on July 3, 1994. In the last round [[MFK Mykolaiv|Evis Mykolaiv]] (Shipbuilders) snatched the ticket to the [[Ukrainian Premier League]] from under the nose of [[PFC Olexandria|Polihraftekhnika Oleksandriya]] (a point ahead of the Shipbuilders) by beating [[FC Naftovyk Okhtyrka|Naftovyk Okhtyrka]] 2:1 after allowing the first goal.\n\nIt is also worth of noting that the newly promoted club from [[Cherkasy]] was leading the league during the winter break and along with the [[Oleksandria]] club was the main contender for promotion. The second half of the season for Dnipro was terrible and they placed in the mid-table after the final round.\n\n==Promotion and relegation==\n\n===Promoted teams===\nTwo clubs promoted from the

It is the largest private real estate development in the United States by area. Upon completion, 13 of the 16 planned structures on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of [[Midtown South]] would sit on a platform built over the [[West Side Yard]], a storage yard for [[Long Island Rail Road]] trains. The first of its two phases, opened in 2019, comprises a public green space and eight structures that contain residences, a hotel, office buildings, a mall, and a cultural facility. The second phase, on which construction has not started yet, will include residential space, an office building, and a school.\n\n[[Related Companies]] and [[Oxford Properties]] are the primary developers and major equity partners in the project. Related and Oxford, along with several large investors, have funded Hudson Yards' construction from a number of [[Financial capital|capital]] sources, including from foreign investors through the [[EB-5 visa|EB-5 investment program]]. [[Mitsui Fudosan]] owns a 92.09 percent stake in [[55 Hudson Yards]], and a 90 percent stake in [[50 Hudson Yards]]. The architectural firm [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]] designed the [[wikt:master plan|master plan]] for the site, and architects including [[Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Foster + Partners]], [[Roche-Dinkeloo]], and [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] contributed designs for individual structures. Major office tenants include or will include fashion company [[Tapestry, Inc.|Tapestry]], consulting firm [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], and [[Alphabet (company)|Alphabet]] subsidiary [[Sidewalk Labs]].\n\nThe site of Hudson Yards was initially intended for other developments, most notably in the early 2000s as the site of the [[West Side Stadium]], during the [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics]]. The plans for Hudson Yards were developed after the failure of the West Side Stadium. Construction began in 2012 with the groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards, and the first phase opened on March 15, 2019. Both phases are projected to be complete by 2024. Agreements between various entities including the [[Government of New York City|local government]], the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), and the state of New York made the development possible.\n\nThe special zoning for Hudson Yards (an area roughly bound by 30th Street in the south, 41st Street in the north, 11th Avenue in the west, and Eighth Avenue in the east) further incentivized the building of other large-scale projects. Hudson Yards is adjacent but unrelated to [[Manhattan West]], [[3 Hudson Boulevard]], and [[The Spiral (New York City)|The Spiral]].\n\n==Site and structures==\n{{Hudson Yards map}}\nThe eastern portion of the site, developed as Phase 1, contains two office towers on Tenth Avenue, plus a retail podium between them. It is projected that all of the Phase 1 buildings would receive a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold designation.<ref name=\"chelseanow 2015012\" />\n\n===10 Hudson Yards===\n[[File:10 Hudson Yard from 9 Av & 30 St 2016 Dec jeh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[10 Hudson Yards]]]]\n{{main|10 Hudson Yards}}\nThe 52-story, {{convert|895|ft|m|adj=on}} 10 Hudson Yards is located at Tenth Avenue and 30th Street, along the southeastern corner of Phase 1.

It is the largest private real estate development in the United States by area. Upon completion, 13 of the 16 planned structures on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of [[Midtown South]] would sit on a platform built over the [[West Side Yard]], a storage yard for [[Long Island Rail Road]] trains. The first of its two phases, opened in 2019, comprises a public green space and eight structures that contain residences, a hotel, office buildings, a mall, and a cultural facility. The second phase, on which construction has not started yet, will include residential space, an office building, and a school.\n\n[[Related Companies]] and [[Oxford Properties]] are the primary developers and major equity partners in the project. Related and Oxford, along with several large investors, have funded Hudson Yards' construction from a number of [[Financial capital|capital]] sources, including from foreign investors through the [[EB-5 visa|EB-5 investment program]]. [[Mitsui Fudosan]] owns a 92.09 percent stake in [[55 Hudson Yards]], and a 90 percent stake in [[50 Hudson Yards]]. The architectural firm [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]] designed the [[wikt:master plan|master plan]] for the site, and architects including  [[Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Foster + Partners]], [[Roche-Dinkeloo]], and [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] contributed designs for individual structures. Major office tenants include or will include fashion company [[Tapestry, Inc.|Tapestry]], consulting firm [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], and [[Alphabet (company)|Alphabet]] subsidiary [[Sidewalk Labs]].\n\nThe site of Hudson Yards was initially intended for other developments, most notably in the early 2000s as the site of the [[West Side Stadium]], during the [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics]]. The plans for Hudson Yards were developed after the failure of the West Side Stadium. Construction began in 2012 with the groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards, and the first phase opened on March 15, 2019. Both phases are projected to be complete by 2024. Agreements between various entities including the [[Government of New York City|local government]], the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), and the state of New York made the development possible.\n\nThe special zoning for Hudson Yards (an area roughly bound by 30th Street in the south, 41st Street in the north, 11th Avenue in the west, and Eighth Avenue in the east) further incentivized the building of other large-scale projects. Hudson Yards is adjacent but unrelated to [[Manhattan West]], [[3 Hudson Boulevard]], and [[The Spiral (New York City)|The Spiral]].\n\n==Site and structures==\n{{Hudson Yards map}}\nThe eastern portion of the site, developed as Phase 1, contains two office towers on Tenth Avenue, plus a retail podium between them.

Owen served as the first state geologist for three states: Kentucky (1854\u201357), Arkansas (1857\u201359), and Indiana (1837\u201339 and 1859\u201360). His first geological work was as an assistant mapping the geology of [[Tennessee]] in 1836. In addition, Owen was appointed as a U.S. geologist in 1839 and led federal surveys of Iowa, Wisconsin, and northern [[Illinois]] (1839\u201340) and in the Upper Midwest (1847-1851). Owen's greatest legacy lies in the eleven volumes of published reports from his state and federal geological surveys, which increased the general knowledge and understanding of American geology, the structural geology and [[paleontology]] of the United States, and the mineral wealth of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states. Owen's most significant contribution to the field of geology was identifying and naming major geological formations of the [[Mississippi River]] Valley and placing them in relative position on a geological timeline. He also helped to standardize the nomenclature of geological structures in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n\nDavid Dale was the third surviving son of [[Robert Owen]], a Welsh-born socialist reformer who established a [[social experiment]] at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. The experiment failed within few years, but David Dale and his three brothers, [[Robert Dale Owen]], William, and [[Richard Dale Owen]], as well as their sister, Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy, established a permanent home at New Harmony. Owen amassed an extensive personal collection of natural history specimens at New Harmony, as well as a geological laboratory and museum that served as the headquarters of the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] until 1856. In addition to his geological survey work, Owen had a minor role in the preliminary design of the [[Smithsonian Institution Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and recommended the distinctive, dark-red [[Seneca Creek (Potomac River)| Seneca Creek]] [[sandstone]] that was used in its construction.\n\n==Early life and education==\nDavid Dale Owen was born in [[Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]], on 24 June 1807, to Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale and [[Robert Owen]]. His mother was the daughter of [[David Dale]], a wealthy Scottish textile manufacturer. His Welsh-born father, a part-owner and manager of the New Lanark Mills at [[New Lanark]], Scotland, was a noted socialist reformer and philanthropist who established experimental utopian communities in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web | author = | title =Robert Owen Timeline | work = | publisher =Robert Owen Museum | date =2008 | url =http://robert-owen-museum.org.uk/time_line | format = | accessdate =29 August 2017 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20181010123944/http://robert-owen-museum.org.uk/time_line | archive-date =10 October 2018 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Linda C.

Owen served as the first state geologist for three states: Kentucky (1854\u201357), Arkansas (1857\u201359), and Indiana (1837\u201339 and 1859\u201360). His first geological work was as an assistant mapping the geology of [[Tennessee]] in 1836. In addition, Owen was appointed as a U.S. geologist in 1839 and led federal surveys of Iowa, Wisconsin, and northern [[Illinois]] (1839\u201340) and in the Upper Midwest (1847-1851). Owen's greatest legacy lies in the eleven volumes of published reports from his state and federal geological surveys, which increased the general knowledge and understanding of American geology, the structural geology and [[paleontology]] of the United States, and the mineral wealth of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states. Owen's most significant contribution to the field of geology was identifying and naming major geological formations of the [[Mississippi River]] Valley and placing them in relative position on a geological timeline. He also helped to standardize the nomenclature of geological structures in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n\nDavid Dale was the third surviving son of [[Robert Owen]], a Welsh-born socialist reformer who established a [[social experiment]] at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. The experiment failed within few years, but David Dale and his three brothers, [[Robert Dale Owen]], William, and [[Richard Dale Owen]], as well as their sister, Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy, established a permanent home at New Harmony. Owen amassed an extensive personal collection of natural history specimens at New Harmony, as well as a geological laboratory and museum that served as the headquarters of the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] until 1856. In addition to his geological survey work, Owen had a minor role in the preliminary design of the [[Smithsonian Institution Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and recommended the distinctive, dark-red [[Seneca Creek (Potomac River)| Seneca Creek]] [[sandstone]] that was used in its construction.\n\n==Early life and education==\nDavid Dale Owen was born in [[Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]], on 24 June 1807, to Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale and [[Robert Owen]]. His mother was the daughter of [[David Dale]], a wealthy Scottish textile manufacturer. His Welsh-born father, a part-owner and manager of the New Lanark Mills at [[New Lanark]], Scotland, was a noted socialist reformer and philanthropist who established experimental utopian communities in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web | author = | title =Robert Owen Timeline | work = | publisher =Robert Owen Museum | date =2008 | url =http://robert-owen-museum.org.uk/time_line | format = | accessdate =29 August 2017 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20181010123944/http://robert-owen-museum.org.uk/time_line | archive-date =10 October 2018 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Linda C.

Through this work he established himself as a leading authority on the region's geology. Owen became the first state geologist of three states: Kentucky (1854\u201357), Arkansas (1857\u201359), and Indiana (1837\u201339 and 1850\u201360).

In March 1837 Indiana governor [[Noah Noble]] appointed him as the first state geologist of Indiana.

Owen submitted two reports of this initial survey to the state legislature. These early reports served as the basis for the research of other Indiana state geologists who succeeded him. In March 1838 Owen was reappointed for another year of survey research in the state.<ref>Hendrickson, \"David Dale Owen and Indiana's First Geological Survey,\" pp. 5\u201310, 13.</ref>\n\n===Federal and state geologist===\nIn July 1839 Owen received an appointment as the U.S. geologist. In this role he led federal surveys from 1839 to 1840 and from 1847 to 1851 of the [[Midwestern United States]], which included [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and part of northern [[Illinois]]. His reports for these pioneering surveys, in addition to other surveys he made before his death in 1860, established his reputation as one of the era's leading experts on the geology of the [[Midwestern United States|Middle West]].<ref name=Estabrook88/><ref>Hendrickson, ''David Dale Owen'', pp. 41\u201343, 48\u201350, 58, 84\u201386.</ref> \n\nFrom 1839 to 1840 Owen conducted surveys in Iowa, Wisconsin, and northern Illinois.<ref name=Kimberling11/> In 1845 he was appointed to survey the Chippewa Land District in the [[Upper Mississippi River]] Valley.

In 1846 he also recommended the [[Seneca Quarry]]'s distinctive, dark-red [[Seneca Creek (Potomac River)|Seneca Creek]] sandstone that was used in its construction.

Although Owen's early drawings were not the final choice for the project, they influenced the designs that other architects developed.

His surveys reports increased the general knowledge and understanding of American geology, the structural geology and paleontology of the United States, and the mineral wealth of the Midwestern United States. Owen provided detailed reports of his observations, which aided later geologists in their research; however, some of his interpretations, inferences, and theories derived from his observations and research were incorrect. Owen's most significant contribution to the field was identifying and naming major geological formations of the [[Mississippi River]] Valley and placing them in relative position on a geological timeline. Owen also helped standardize the nomenclature of geological structures in the Midwest.<ref>Hendrickson, ''David Dale Owen'', pp. 132\u201334.</ref>\n\nAnother Owen legacy was the geologists he trained. These men include \nJohn Evans, a surveyor for the western United States; [[Fielding Bradford Meek]], the first full-time paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution; Joseph Granville Norwood, one of Owen's colleagues, coauthors, and the first state geologist of Illinois (1851\u201358); Edward T. Cox, who later surveyed Indiana; C. C. Parry, a botanist of Iowa; Benjamin Franklin Shumard, appointed state geologist of [[Texas]]; [[Amos Henry Worthen]], the second state geologist of Illinois and the first curator of the [[Illinois State Museum]]; and Owen's younger brother, Richard, who succeeded him to become the second state geologist of Indiana.<ref name=Kimber15/><ref name=Estabrook89/><ref>Hendrickson, ''David Dale Owen'', p. 137.

He founded the religion of [[Thelema]], identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the [[\u00c6on of Horus]] in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.\n\nBorn to a wealthy family in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], Crowley rejected his parent's [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] [[Plymouth Brethren]] faith to pursue an interest in [[Western esotericism]]. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a [[British intelligence agency]], further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898 he joined the esoteric [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], where he was trained in ceremonial magic by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]] and [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett]]. Moving to [[Boleskine House]] by [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland, he went mountaineering in Mexico with [[Oscar Eckenstein]], before studying [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] practices in India. He married [[Rose Edith Kelly]] and in 1904 they honeymooned in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named [[Aiwass]], who provided him with ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema. Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus, ''The Book'' declared that its followers should \"Do what thou wilt\" and seek to align themselves with their [[True Will]] through the practice of [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]].\n\nAfter [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga]] and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and [[George Cecil Jones]] co-founded an esoteric order, the [[A\u2234A\u2234]], through which they propagated Thelema. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order, the German-based [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), rising to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through the O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the [[First World War]] in the United States, where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain, later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920 he established the [[Abbey of Thelema]], a religious commune in [[Cefal\u00f9]], Sicily where he lived with various followers. His [[libertine]] lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death.\n\nCrowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a [[recreational drug]] experimenter, [[bisexual]] and an [[individualist]] [[social critic]]. He has been called \"the wickedest man in the world\" and labeled as a [[Satanist]] by the popular press. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the [[counterculture]], and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema. He is the subject of various biographies and academic studies.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Youth: 1875\u20131894===\n[[File:Aleister Crowley birthplace.jpg|thumb|alt=2017 photograph of Crowley's birthplace|Aleister Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.]]\n\nCrowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=4\u20135|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=15|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=14}} His father, Edward Crowley (1829\u20131887), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Alton Ales, had allowed him to retire before his son was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=31\u201323|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=4\u20138|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=14\u201315}} His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848\u20131917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as \"the Beast\", a name that he revelled in.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=18\u201321|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=13\u201316|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=17\u201321}} The couple had been married at London's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=13\u201314|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=17}} and were evangelical Christians. Crowley's father had been born a [[Quaker]], but had converted to the [[Exclusive Brethren]], a faction of a [[Christian fundamentalist]] group known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]], with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowley's father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=3\u20134, 6, 9\u201310|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=17\u201323|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=11\u201312, 16}} Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], Surrey.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=16|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=24}} At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T.

Crowley developed interests in [[chess]], poetry, and [[mountain climbing]], and in 1894 climbed [[Beachy Head]] before visiting the [[Alps]] and joining the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]].

Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with [[John Dee]]'s [[Enochian]] invocations. He later claimed to have been initiated into [[Freemasonry]] while there, and he wrote a play based on [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' as well as a series of poems, published as ''Oracles'' (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including [[Iztaccihuatl]], [[Popocat\u00e9petl|Popocatepetl]], and [[Volc\u00e1n de Colima|Colima]], the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=127\u201337|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=80\u201386|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=83\u201390|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=64\u201370}} Spence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence.{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=32}} Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the ''Nippon Maru''. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he had fallen in love with her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as ''Alice: An Adultery'' (1903).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=137\u201339|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=86\u201390|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=90\u201393|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=71\u201375}}\n\n[[File:Aleister Crowley 1902 K2.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Crowley bathing in a spring during the K2 Expedition|Crowley during the K2 Expedition]]\nBriefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong, Crowley reached Ceylon, where he met with Allan Bennett, who was there studying [[Shaivism]].

He spent much of this time studying at the [[Meenakshi Temple]] in [[Madurai|Madura]]. At this time he also composed and also wrote poetry which was published as ''The Sword of Song'' (1904). He contracted [[malaria]], and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=144\u201347|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=94\u201398|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=96\u201398|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=78\u201383}} In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V.&nbsp;Wesseley, and [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod]]. Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted [[K2]], which had never been climbed. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with [[influenza]], malaria, and [[snow blindness]], and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of {{convert|20000|ft|m}} before turning back.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=148\u201356|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=98\u2013104|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=98\u2013108|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=83}}\n\nHaving arrived in Paris in November 1902 he socialised with friend and future brother-in-law, the painter [[Gerald Festus Kelly|Gerald Kelly]], and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene.

Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon, he wrote her a series of love poems, published as ''Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs'' (1906), as well as authoring the religious satire ''Why Jesus Wept'' (1904).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=171\u201377|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=110\u201316|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=119\u201324|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=89\u201390}}\n\n==Developing Thelema==\n\n===Egypt and ''The Book of the Law'': 1904===\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Had!

She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary [[stele]] known as the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]]; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit's number was 666, the [[Number of the Beast]] in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the \"Stele of Revealing.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=182\u201383|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=120\u201322|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=124\u201326|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=96\u201398}}\n\nAccording to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of [[Aiwass]], the messenger of Horus, or [[Heru-ra-ha|Hoor-Paar-Kraat]]. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it ''Liber AL vel Legis'' or ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184\u201388|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=122\u201325|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=127\u201329}} The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]], and that Crowley would serve as its [[prophet]]. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\" and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will.

Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=139|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=129}}\n\n===Kanchenjunga and China: 1905\u201306===\nReturning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=189, 194\u201395|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=140\u201341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=130|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic ''Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden'' to entertain his recuperating wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=195\u201396|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=132|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]].

In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of \u00a3100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was [[J. F. C.

Many of his articles in ''The Fatherland'' were hyperbolic, for instance comparing [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt\u2014reported on by ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the [[Statue of Liberty]]; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1pp=247\u201348|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201376|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=284\u201387, 292\u201392|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5pp=190\u201393}} It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the ''Lusitania'', informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain's side.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2008|1pp=82\u201389|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2pp=195\u201397}}\n\nCrowley entered into a relationship with [[Jeanne Robert Foster]], with whom he toured the West Coast. In [[Vancouver]], headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] and [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent.

He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship.{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2012|1p=210|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=3}} He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus,{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=88}} and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=51}} Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Drury|2y=2012|2p=209}} Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one's True Will to be \"the Great Work\" or the attaining of the \"knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\".{{sfn|Asprem|2013|pp=88\u201389}} His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire.{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=89}} The moral code of \"Do What Thou Wilt\" is believed by Thelemites to be the religion's ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not [[anarchism|anarchistic]] or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}}\n\n===Magick and theology===\nCrowley believed in the objective existence of [[magic (supernatural)|magic]], which he chose to spell \"Magick\", an older archaic spelling of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Asprem|2y=2013|2p=89|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He provided various different definitions of this term over his career.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In his book ''Magick in Theory and Practice'', Crowley defined Magick as \"the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=DuQuette|2y=2003|2p=11|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He also told his disciple Karl Germer that \"Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level.\"{{sfn|Churton|2011|p=417}} Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving ''The Equinox'' the subtitle of ''The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion''.{{sfnm|1a1=Asprem|1y=2008|1p=140|2a1=Bogdan|2a2=Starr|2y=2012|2p=4}} Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the [[scientific method]],{{sfn|Asprem|2008|p=150}} and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, \"The more scientific the record is, the better.\"{{sfn|Asprem|2008|pp=151\u201352}} His understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework.{{sfn|Asprem|2008|pp=145, 149}} Unlike Frazer, however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science.{{sfn|Asprem|2008|p=150}} In Crowley's alternative schema, old systems of ''magic'' had to decline (per Frazer's framework) so that science and magic could synthesize into ''magick'', which would simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an [[experiment|experimental method]].{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=170}} Crowley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick, adopting an [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] interpretation of magic, science, and technology.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=172\u201373}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"To [Crowley] the greatest aim of the magician was to merge with a higher power connected to the wellsprings of the universe, but he did not trouble himself too much to define that power consistently; sometimes it was God, sometimes the One, sometimes a goddess, and sometimes one's own Holy Guardian Angel or higher self. In the last analysis he was content for the nature of divinity to remain a mystery. As a result he wrote at times like an atheist, at times like a monotheist, and at others like a polytheist.\"|source=The historian [[Ronald Hutton]]{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=180}}}}\n\nSexuality played an important role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=173}} and has been described as being central to Thelema.{{sfn|Drury|2012|p=216}} He outlined three forms of sex magick\u2014the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual\u2014and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success.{{sfn|Drury|2012|p=213}} For Crowley, sex was treated as a [[sacrament]], with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=44}} This was often manifested as the [[Cake of Light|Cakes of Light]], a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids.{{sfn|Drury|2012|p=210}} The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=99}}\n\nCrowley's theological beliefs were not clear. The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that some of Crowley's writings could be used to argue that he was an [[atheism|atheist]],{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} while some support the idea that he was a [[polytheism|polytheist]],{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=180}} and others would bolster the idea that he was a [[mysticism|mystical]] [[monotheism|monotheist]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=176}} On the basis of the teachings in ''The Book of the Law'', Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=178}} In 1928, he made the claim that all \"true\" deities were \"derived\" from this trinity.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=178}} Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that Crowley built on 19th-century attempts to [[Jesus in comparative mythology|link early Christianity to Paganism]], such as Frazer's ''Golden Bough'', to synthesize Christian theology and Neopaganism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional Christianity.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=165}}\n\nBoth during his life and after it, Crowley has been widely described as a [[Satanism|Satanist]], usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship [[Satan]], as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=175|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2pp=369\u201370}} He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as \"the Beast 666\" and referring to the [[Whore of Babylon]] in his work, while in later life he sent \"[[Christmas card|Antichristmas cards]]\" to his friends.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=175}} In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as \"Our Lord God the Devil\" at one occasion.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=309}} The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley \"was emphatically not\" a Satanist, \"if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=58}} Crowley nevertheless expressed anti-Christian sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity \"as Socialists hate soap\",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=176}} an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=175}} He was also accused of advocating [[human sacrifice]], largely because of a passage in ''Book 4'' in which he stated that \"A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim\" and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to [[ejaculation]], something not realised by his critics, thus reflecting their own \"ignorance and prejudice\" toward Crowley.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=120\u201321}}\n\n==Personal life==\nCrowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] stated that in Crowley's youth, he was \"a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man\" who \"set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms\", while being shielded from an \"outraged public opinion\" by his inherited wealth.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} Hutton also described Crowley as having both an \"unappeasable desire\" to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and \"a tendency to quarrel savagely\" with those who challenged him.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} Crowley biographer [[Martin Booth]] asserted that Crowley was \"self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=125}} Similarly, Richard Spence noted that Crowley was \"capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty\".{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=10}} Biographer [[Lawrence Sutin]] noted that Crowley exhibited \"courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will\" while at the same time showing a \"blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=148}} The Thelemite [[Lon Milo DuQuette]] noted that Crowley \"was by no means perfect\" and \"often alienated those who loved him dearest.\"{{sfn|DuQuette|2003|p=9}}\n===Political views===\nCrowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality,{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=33}} with [[John Symonds]] noting that he \"was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time\".{{sfn|Symonds|1997|p=vii}} Crowley's political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=23}} He was neither on the political [[Left-wing politics|left]] nor [[Right-wing politics|right]] but perhaps best categorised as a \"conservative revolutionary\" despite not being affiliated with the German-based [[conservative revolutionary movement]].{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=49\u201350}} Pasi described Crowley's affinity to the extreme ideologies of [[Nazism]] and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], which aimed to violently overturn society: \"What Crowley liked about Nazism and communism, or at least what made him curious about them, was the anti-Christian position and the revolutionary and socially subversive implications of these two movements. In their subversive powers, he saw the possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions, and the creation of a void that Thelema, subsequently, would be able to fill.\"{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=52\u201353}} Crowley described democracy as an \"imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness\",{{sfn|Morgan|2011|p=166}} and commented that ''The Book of the Law'' proclaimed that \"there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the 'lone wolf' and the herd\".{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}} In this attitude he was influenced by the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and by [[Social Darwinism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1p=129|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=401|3a1=Pasi|3y=2014|3p=48}} Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=109}} once describing his ideology as \"aristocratic communism\".{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=50}}\n\n===Views on race and gender===\nCrowley was bisexual, and exhibited a sexual preference for women,{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2p=67|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3p=19}} with his relationships with men being fewer and clustered in the early part of his life.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In particular he had an attraction toward \"exotic women\",{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=130}} and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that \"when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived\".{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=91}} Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=350}} He applied the term \"Scarlet Woman\" to various female lovers whom he believed played an important role in his magical work.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=94}} During homosexual [[anal sex|anal intercourse]], he usually played the passive role,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=63|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=159}} which Booth believed \"appealed to his masochistic side\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=63}} An underlying theme in many of his writings is that spiritual enlightenment arises through transgressing socio-sexual norms.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=48}}\n\nCrowley advocated complete sexual freedom for both men and women.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=104}} He argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} commenting that a person \"must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise.\"{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=128}} On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=176|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=145|3a1=Hedenborg White|3y=2020|3pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nBiographer Lawrence Sutin stated that \"blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley's writings\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|pp=223\u201324}} Sutin thought Crowley \"a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst [[John Bull]] racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries\", noting that he \"embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society, coupled with a fascination with people of colour\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|pp=2, 336}} Crowley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg using [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] slurs and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group. Although he praised their \"sublime\" poetry and stated that they exhibited \"imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity\", he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit \"avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|pp=268\u201369}} He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a \"spiritual superiority\" to the English,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=137}} and praised Muslims for exhibiting \"manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=180}}\n\nBoth critics of Crowley and adherents of Thelema have accused Crowley of [[sexism]].{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=5}} Booth described Crowley as exhibiting a \"general misogyny\", something the biographer believed arose from Crowley's bad relationship with his mother.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=61}} Sutin noted that Crowley \"largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=28}} The scholar of religion Manon Hedenborg White noted that some of Crowley's statements were \"undoubtedly misogynist by contemporary standards\" although stressed that his attitude to women was complex and multi-faceted.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=111}} Crowley's comments on women's role varied dramatically within his written work, even that produced in similar periods.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=111}} Crowley described women as \"moral inferiors\" who had to be treated with \"firmness, kindness and justice\",{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=114}} while also arguing that Thelema was essential to women's emancipation.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=105}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"[H]e is today looked upon as a source of inspiration by many people in search of spiritual enlightenment and/\nor instructions in magical practice.

Furthermore, Crowley's influence over magically oriented new religious movements has in some cases been very deep and pervasive. It would be difficult to understand, for instance, some aspects of Anglo-Saxon neo-paganism and contemporary satanism without a solid knowledge of Crowley's doctrines and ideas. In other fields, such as poetry, alpinism and painting, he may have been a minor figure, but it is only fair to admit that, in the limited context of occultism, he has played and still plays a major role.\" |source=Marco Pasi, 2003.{{sfn|Pasi|2003|p=225}}}}\n\nCrowley has remained an influential figure, both amongst occultists and in popular culture, particularly that of Britain, but also of other parts of the world.

In 1969, the O.T.O. was reactivated in California under the leadership of Grady Louis McMurtry;{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}} in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group, the Society Ordo Templi Orientis, led by Brazilian Thelemite [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]].{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}}\nAnother American Thelemite is the filmmaker [[Kenneth Anger]], who had been influenced by Crowley's writings from a young age.{{sfnm|1a1=Landis|1y=1995|1pp=26\u201334|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=1\u20133}} In the United Kingdom, [[Kenneth Grant]] propagated a tradition known as Typhonian Thelema through his organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., later renamed the [[Typhonian Order]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=284\u2013350}}\nAlso in Britain, an occultist known as [[Amado Crowley]] claimed to be Crowley's son; this has been refuted by academic investigation. Amado argued that Thelema was a false religion created by Crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings, which Amado claimed to be propagating.{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=229\u201383}}\n\nSeveral Western esoteric traditions other than Thelema were also influenced by Crowley, with Djurdjevic observing that \"Crowley's influence on twentieth-century and contemporary esotericism has been enormous\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|pp=35\u201336}} Gerald Gardner, founder of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], made use of much of Crowley's published material when composing the Gardnerian ritual liturgy,{{sfn|Hutton|2012|pp=285\u2013306}} and the Australian witch [[Rosaleen Norton]] was also heavily influenced by Crowley's ideas.{{sfn|Richmond|2012|pp=307\u201334}} More widely, Crowley became \"a dominant figure\" in the modern Pagan community.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=180}} [[L.

1875 \u2013 1 December 1947) was an English [[occultist]], [[ceremonial magic]]ian, poet, painter, novelist, and mountaineer. He founded the religion of [[Thelema]], identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the [[\u00c6on of Horus]] in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.\n\nBorn to a wealthy family in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], Crowley rejected his parent's [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] [[Plymouth Brethren]] faith to pursue an interest in [[Western esotericism]]. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a [[British intelligence agency]], further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898 he joined the esoteric [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], where he was trained in ceremonial magic by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]] and [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett]]. Moving to [[Boleskine House]] by [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland, he went mountaineering in Mexico with [[Oscar Eckenstein]], before studying [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] practices in India. He married [[Rose Edith Kelly]] and in 1904 they honeymooned in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named [[Aiwass]], who provided him with ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema. Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus, ''The Book'' declared that its followers should \"Do what thou wilt\" and seek to align themselves with their [[True Will]] through the practice of [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]].\n\nAfter [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga]] and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and [[George Cecil Jones]] co-founded an esoteric order, the [[A\u2234A\u2234]], through which they propagated Thelema. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order, the German-based [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), rising to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through the O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the [[First World War]] in the United States, where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain, later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920 he established the [[Abbey of Thelema]], a religious commune in [[Cefal\u00f9]], Sicily where he lived with various followers. His [[libertine]] lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death.\n\nCrowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a [[recreational drug]] experimenter, [[bisexual]] and an [[individualist]] [[social critic]]. He has been called \"the wickedest man in the world\" and labeled as a [[Satanist]] by the popular press. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the [[counterculture]], and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema. He is the subject of various biographies and academic studies.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Youth: 1875\u20131894===\n[[File:Aleister Crowley birthplace.jpg|thumb|alt=2017 photograph of Crowley's birthplace|Aleister Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.]]\n\nCrowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=4\u20135|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=15|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=14}} His father, Edward Crowley (1829\u20131887), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Alton Ales, had allowed him to retire before his son was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=31\u201323|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=4\u20138|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=14\u201315}} His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848\u20131917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as \"the Beast\", a name that he revelled in.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=18\u201321|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=13\u201316|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=17\u201321}} The couple had been married at London's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=13\u201314|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=17}} and were evangelical Christians. Crowley's father had been born a [[Quaker]], but had converted to the [[Exclusive Brethren]], a faction of a [[Christian fundamentalist]] group known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]], with Emily joining him upon marriage.

She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary [[stele]] known as the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]]; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit's number was 666, the [[Number of the Beast]] in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the \"Stele of Revealing.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=182\u201383|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=120\u201322|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=124\u201326|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=96\u201398}}\n\nAccording to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of [[Aiwass]], the messenger of Horus, or [[Heru-ra-ha|Hoor-Paar-Kraat]]. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it ''Liber AL vel Legis'' or ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184\u201388|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=122\u201325|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=127\u201329}} The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]], and that Crowley would serve as its [[prophet]]. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\" and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley's religion, [[Thelema]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184\u201388|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=125\u201333}} Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with ''The Book of the Law''. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=139|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=129}}\n\n===Kanchenjunga and China: 1905\u201306===\nReturning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=189, 194\u201395|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=140\u201341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=130|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic ''Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden'' to entertain his recuperating wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=195\u201396|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=132|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]].

In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of \u00a3100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was [[J. F. C. Fuller]], a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, ''The Star in the West'' (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=241\u201342|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=177\u201379|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=136\u201337, 139, 168\u201369}}\n\n[[File:Kanchenjunga India.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A photograph of Kangchenjunga|[[Kangchenjunga|Kanchenjunga]], as seen from [[Darjeeling]]]]\n\nCrowley decided to climb [[Kangchenjunga|Kanchenjunga]] in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely recognised as the world's most treacherous mountain.

Rigo de Righi, [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|the expedition]] was marred by much argument between Crowley and the others, who thought that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous.

Crowley convinced Reuss that the similarities were coincidental, and the two became friends. Reuss appointed Crowley as head of the O.T.O's British branch, the Mysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM), and at a ceremony in [[Berlin]] Crowley adopted the magical name of [[Baphomet]] and was proclaimed \"X\u00b0 Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britons\".{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=302\u201305|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=225\u201326|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=251\u201325}} With Reuss' permission, Crowley set about advertising the MMM and re-writing many O.T.O. rituals, which were then based largely on [[Freemasonry]]; his incorporation of Thelemite elements proved controversial in the group. Fascinated by the O.T.O's emphasis on [[sex magic]], Crowley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.T.O. members who had been initiated into the [[Ordo Templi Orientis#Initiation and teachings|eleventh degree]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=306|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=228|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=256}}\n\nIn March 1913 Crowley acted as producer for ''The Ragged Ragtime Girls'', a group of female violinists led by Waddell, as they performed at London's [[Old Tivoli]] theatre.

As part of the ritual, the couple performed acts of sex magic together, at times being joined by journalist [[Walter Duranty]]. Inspired by the results of the Working, Crowley wrote ''Liber Agap\u00e9'', a treatise on sex magic.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=313\u201316|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=235\u201340|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=269\u201374}} Following the Paris Working, Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley, resulting in an argument in which Crowley [[curse]]d him.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=317\u201319|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=240\u201341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=275\u201376}}\n\n===United States: 1914\u20131919===\nBy 1914 Crowley was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on donations from A\u2234A\u2234 members and dues payments made to O.T.O.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=321}} In May he transferred ownership of Boleskine House to the MMM for financial reasons,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=321\u201322|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=240|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=277|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=186}} and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps.

He became involved in New York's pro-German movement, and in January 1915 German spy [[George Sylvester Viereck]] employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper, ''[[The Fatherland]]'', which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=326\u201330|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=245\u201347|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=283\u201384}} In later years, detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1p=247|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=186}} In reality, Crowley was a double agent, working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate and undermine Germany's operation in New York. Many of his articles in ''The Fatherland'' were hyperbolic, for instance comparing [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt\u2014reported on by ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the [[Statue of Liberty]]; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1pp=247\u201348|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201376|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=284\u201387, 292\u201392|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5pp=190\u201393}} It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the ''Lusitania'', informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain's side.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2008|1pp=82\u201389|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2pp=195\u201397}}\n\nCrowley entered into a relationship with [[Jeanne Robert Foster]], with whom he toured the West Coast. In [[Vancouver]], headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] and [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent.

He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship.{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2012|1p=210|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=3}} He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus,{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=88}} and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=51}} Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Drury|2y=2012|2p=209}} Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one's True Will to be \"the Great Work\" or the attaining of the \"knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\".{{sfn|Asprem|2013|pp=88\u201389}} His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire.{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=89}} The moral code of \"Do What Thou Wilt\" is believed by Thelemites to be the religion's ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not [[anarchism|anarchistic]] or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}}\n\n===Magick and theology===\nCrowley believed in the objective existence of [[magic (supernatural)|magic]], which he chose to spell \"Magick\", an older archaic spelling of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Asprem|2y=2013|2p=89|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He provided various different definitions of this term over his career.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In his book ''Magick in Theory and Practice'', Crowley defined Magick as \"the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=DuQuette|2y=2003|2p=11|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He also told his disciple Karl Germer that \"Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level.\"{{sfn|Churton|2011|p=417}} Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving ''The Equinox'' the subtitle of ''The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion''.{{sfnm|1a1=Asprem|1y=2008|1p=140|2a1=Bogdan|2a2=Starr|2y=2012|2p=4}} Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the [[scientific method]],{{sfn|Asprem|2008|p=150}} and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, \"The more scientific the record is, the better.\"{{sfn|Asprem|2008|pp=151\u201352}} His understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework.{{sfn|Asprem|2008|pp=145, 149}} Unlike Frazer, however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science.{{sfn|Asprem|2008|p=150}} In Crowley's alternative schema, old systems of ''magic'' had to decline (per Frazer's framework) so that science and magic could synthesize into ''magick'', which would simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an [[experiment|experimental method]].{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=170}} Crowley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick, adopting an [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] interpretation of magic, science, and technology.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=172\u201373}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"To [Crowley] the greatest aim of the magician was to merge with a higher power connected to the wellsprings of the universe, but he did not trouble himself too much to define that power consistently; sometimes it was God, sometimes the One, sometimes a goddess, and sometimes one's own Holy Guardian Angel or higher self.

The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that some of Crowley's writings could be used to argue that he was an [[atheism|atheist]],{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} while some support the idea that he was a [[polytheism|polytheist]],{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=180}} and others would bolster the idea that he was a [[mysticism|mystical]] [[monotheism|monotheist]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=176}} On the basis of the teachings in ''The Book of the Law'', Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=178}} In 1928, he made the claim that all \"true\" deities were \"derived\" from this trinity.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=178}} Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that Crowley built on 19th-century attempts to [[Jesus in comparative mythology|link early Christianity to Paganism]], such as Frazer's ''Golden Bough'', to synthesize Christian theology and Neopaganism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional Christianity.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=165}}\n\nBoth during his life and after it, Crowley has been widely described as a [[Satanism|Satanist]], usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship [[Satan]], as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=175|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2pp=369\u201370}} He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as \"the Beast 666\" and referring to the [[Whore of Babylon]] in his work, while in later life he sent \"[[Christmas card|Antichristmas cards]]\" to his friends.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=175}} In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as \"Our Lord God the Devil\" at one occasion.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=309}} The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley \"was emphatically not\" a Satanist, \"if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=58}} Crowley nevertheless expressed anti-Christian sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity \"as Socialists hate soap\",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=176}} an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=175}} He was also accused of advocating [[human sacrifice]], largely because of a passage in ''Book 4'' in which he stated that \"A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim\" and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to [[ejaculation]], something not realised by his critics, thus reflecting their own \"ignorance and prejudice\" toward Crowley.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=120\u201321}}\n\n==Personal life==\nCrowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] stated that in Crowley's youth, he was \"a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man\" who \"set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms\", while being shielded from an \"outraged public opinion\" by his inherited wealth.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} Hutton also described Crowley as having both an \"unappeasable desire\" to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and \"a tendency to quarrel savagely\" with those who challenged him.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} Crowley biographer [[Martin Booth]] asserted that Crowley was \"self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=125}} Similarly, Richard Spence noted that Crowley was \"capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty\".{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=10}} Biographer [[Lawrence Sutin]] noted that Crowley exhibited \"courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will\" while at the same time showing a \"blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=148}} The Thelemite [[Lon Milo DuQuette]] noted that Crowley \"was by no means perfect\" and \"often alienated those who loved him dearest.\"{{sfn|DuQuette|2003|p=9}}\n===Political views===\nCrowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality,{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=33}} with [[John Symonds]] noting that he \"was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time\".{{sfn|Symonds|1997|p=vii}} Crowley's political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=23}} He was neither on the political [[Left-wing politics|left]] nor [[Right-wing politics|right]] but perhaps best categorised as a \"conservative revolutionary\" despite not being affiliated with the German-based [[conservative revolutionary movement]].{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=49\u201350}} Pasi described Crowley's affinity to the extreme ideologies of [[Nazism]] and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], which aimed to violently overturn society: \"What Crowley liked about Nazism and communism, or at least what made him curious about them, was the anti-Christian position and the revolutionary and socially subversive implications of these two movements. In their subversive powers, he saw the possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions, and the creation of a void that Thelema, subsequently, would be able to fill.\"{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=52\u201353}} Crowley described democracy as an \"imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness\",{{sfn|Morgan|2011|p=166}} and commented that ''The Book of the Law'' proclaimed that \"there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the 'lone wolf' and the herd\".{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}} In this attitude he was influenced by the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and by [[Social Darwinism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1p=129|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=401|3a1=Pasi|3y=2014|3p=48}} Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=109}} once describing his ideology as \"aristocratic communism\".{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=50}}\n\n===Views on race and gender===\nCrowley was bisexual, and exhibited a sexual preference for women,{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2p=67|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3p=19}} with his relationships with men being fewer and clustered in the early part of his life.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In particular he had an attraction toward \"exotic women\",{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=130}} and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that \"when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived\".{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=91}} Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=350}} He applied the term \"Scarlet Woman\" to various female lovers whom he believed played an important role in his magical work.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=94}} During homosexual [[anal sex|anal intercourse]], he usually played the passive role,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=63|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=159}} which Booth believed \"appealed to his masochistic side\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=63}} An underlying theme in many of his writings is that spiritual enlightenment arises through transgressing socio-sexual norms.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=48}}\n\nCrowley advocated complete sexual freedom for both men and women.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=104}} He argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} commenting that a person \"must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise.\"{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=128}} On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=176|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=145|3a1=Hedenborg White|3y=2018|3pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nBiographer Lawrence Sutin stated that \"blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley's writings\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|pp=223\u201324}} Sutin thought Crowley \"a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst [[John Bull]] racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries\", noting that he \"embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society, coupled with a fascination with people of colour\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|pp=2, 336}} Crowley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg using [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] slurs and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group. Although he praised their \"sublime\" poetry and stated that they exhibited \"imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity\", he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit \"avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|pp=268\u201369}} He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a \"spiritual superiority\" to the English,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=137}} and praised Muslims for exhibiting \"manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=180}}\n\nBoth critics of Crowley and adherents of Thelema have accused Crowley of [[sexism]].{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=5}} Booth described Crowley as exhibiting a \"general misogyny\", something the biographer believed arose from Crowley's bad relationship with his mother.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=61}} Sutin noted that Crowley \"largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=28}} The scholar of religion Manon Hedenborg White noted that some of Crowley's statements were \"undoubtedly misogynist by contemporary standards\" although stressed that his attitude to women was complex and multi-faceted.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=111}} Crowley's comments on women's role varied dramatically within his written work, even that produced in similar periods.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=111}} Crowley described women as \"moral inferiors\" who had to be treated with \"firmness, kindness and justice\",{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=114}} while also arguing that Thelema was essential to women's emancipation.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=105}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"[H]e is today looked upon as a source of inspiration by many people in search of spiritual enlightenment and/\nor instructions in magical practice. Thus, while during his life his books hardly sold and his disciples were never very numerous, nowadays all his important works are constantly in print, and the people defining themselves as \"thelemites\" (that is, followers of Crowley's new religion) number several thousands all over the world. Furthermore, Crowley's influence over magically oriented new religious movements has in some cases been very deep and pervasive. It would be difficult to understand, for instance, some aspects of Anglo-Saxon neo-paganism and contemporary satanism without a solid knowledge of Crowley's doctrines and ideas. In other fields, such as poetry, alpinism and painting, he may have been a minor figure, but it is only fair to admit that, in the limited context of occultism, he has played and still plays a major role.\" |source=Marco Pasi, 2003.{{sfn|Pasi|2003|p=225}}}}\n\nCrowley has remained an influential figure, both amongst occultists and in popular culture, particularly that of Britain, but also of other parts of the world. In 2002, a BBC poll placed Crowley seventy-third in a list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].{{sfnm|1a1=Pasi|1y=2003|1p=225|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=3}} [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]] has written of him that \"In native talent, penetrating intelligence and determination, Aleister Crowley was the best-equipped magician to emerge since the seventeenth century.\"{{sfn|Cavendish|1978|p=167}} The scholar of esotericism Egil Asprem described him as \"one of the most well-known figures in modern occultism\".{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=85}} The scholar of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] asserted that Crowley was an extreme representation of \"the dark side of the occult\",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=ix}} adding that he was \"the most notorious occultist magician of the twentieth century\".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=41}} The philosopher John Moore opined that Crowley stood out as a \"Modern Master\" when compared with other prominent occult figures like [[George Gurdjieff]], [[P. D. Ouspensky]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], or [[Helena Blavatsky]],{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=5}} also describing him as a \"living embodiment\" of [[Oswald Spengler]]'s \"[[The Decline of the West|Faustian Man]]\".{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=40}}\nBiographer [[Tobias Churton]] considered Crowley \"a pioneer of consciousness research\".{{sfn|Churton|2011|p=88}} Hutton noted that Crowley had \"an important place in the history of modern Western responses to Oriental spiritual traditions\",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=171}} while Sutin thought that he had made \"distinctly original contributions\" to the study of yoga in the West.{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=93}}\n\nThelema continued to develop and spread following Crowley's death. In 1969, the O.T.O. was reactivated in California under the leadership of Grady Louis McMurtry;{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}} in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group, the Society Ordo Templi Orientis, led by Brazilian Thelemite [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]].{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}}\nAnother American Thelemite is the filmmaker [[Kenneth Anger]], who had been influenced by Crowley's writings from a young age.{{sfnm|1a1=Landis|1y=1995|1pp=26\u201334|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=1\u20133}} In the United Kingdom, [[Kenneth Grant]] propagated a tradition known as Typhonian Thelema through his organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., later renamed the [[Typhonian Order]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=284\u2013350}}\nAlso in Britain, an occultist known as [[Amado Crowley]] claimed to be Crowley's son; this has been refuted by academic investigation. Amado argued that Thelema was a false religion created by Crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings, which Amado claimed to be propagating.{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=229\u201383}}\n\nSeveral Western esoteric traditions other than Thelema were also influenced by Crowley, with Djurdjevic observing that \"Crowley's influence on twentieth-century and contemporary esotericism has been enormous\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|pp=35\u201336}} Gerald Gardner, founder of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], made use of much of Crowley's published material when composing the Gardnerian ritual liturgy,{{sfn|Hutton|2012|pp=285\u2013306}} and the Australian witch [[Rosaleen Norton]] was also heavily influenced by Crowley's ideas.{{sfn|Richmond|2012|pp=307\u201334}} More widely, Crowley became \"a dominant figure\" in the modern Pagan community.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=180}} [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the American founder of [[Scientology]], was involved in Thelema in the early 1940s (with [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]]), and it has been argued that [[Scientology and the occult|Crowley's ideas influenced some of Hubbard's work]].{{sfn|Urban|2012|pp=335\u201368}} The scholars of religion Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendel, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Petersen noted that despite the fact that Crowley was not a Satanist, he \"in many ways embodies the pre-Satanist esoteric discourse on Satan and Satanism through his lifestyle and his philosophy\", with his \"image and ought\" becoming an \"important influence\" on the later development of religious Satanism.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=39}} For instance, two prominent figures in religious Satanism, [[Anton LaVey]] and [[Temple of Set|Michael Aquino]], were influenced by Crowley's work.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|pp=369\u201394}}\n\nCrowley also had a wider influence in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British popular culture]]. After his time in Cefal\u00f9 which had brought him to public attention in Britain, various \"literary Crowleys\" appeared; characters in fiction based upon him.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=103}} One of the earliest was the character of the poet Shelley Arabin in [[John Buchan]]'s 1926 novel ''[[The Dancing Floor]]''.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=103}} In his novel ''[[The Devil Rides Out]]'', the writer [[Dennis Wheatley]] used Crowley as a partial basis for the character of Damien Morcata, a portly bald defrocked priest who engages in black magic.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|pp=106\u201307}} The occultist [[Dion Fortune]] used Crowley as a basis for characters in her books ''The Secrets of Doctor Taverner'' (1926) and ''The Winged Bull'' (1935).{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=105}} He was included as one of the figures on the cover art of [[The Beatles]]' album ''[[Sgt.

He wore a black tuxedo and bowler hat, akin to the [[James Bond]] series character [[Oddjob]], and would carry a little bag of salt on his person. His first client was [[George Steele]].

Fuji and Muraco then began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ricky Steamboat]], resulting in Steamboat defeating Fuji in several matches during the feud. Fuji briefly managed [[Jim Neidhart]], whose contract he later sold to [[Jimmy Hart]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> In 1987, he bought the contract of [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) from [[John L.

Fuji was also known for bringing [[Killer Khan]] and [[Sika Anoa\u02bbi|Sika]] back to the WWF.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Fuji would also acquire Kamala from [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Wizard]] managing him both in singles as well as in a tag team with Sika, and also simultaneously managed [[Bob Orton Jr.|\"Cowboy\" Bob Orton]] (whom he would often have team with Muraco, his other client).\n\nAt [[Survivor Series (1988)|Survivor Series]], he turned on Demolition and began managing Demolition's rival tag team, [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Warlord (wrestler)|Warlord]] and [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|Barbarian]]).<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Interviewed after the contest, Fuji claimed that he had turned on Demolition because, since winning the championship, they had become insubordinate and disrespectful towards him, whereas the Powers would be utterly obedient and loyal apprentices. For their part, Demolition denounced their former manager as a parasite, labelling him \"Fuj the Stooge.\"\n\nAt [[WrestleMania V]], Fuji teamed with the Powers of Pain in a 3-on-2 [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] against Demolition for their Tag Team Championship. Fuji and Powers were defeated after Ax pinned Fuji following a Demolition Decapitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm5/results/|title=WrestleMania V official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=August 28, 2008}}</ref> Fuji sold the individual contracts of Powers of Pain to [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] and [[Bobby Heenan]] and brought [[The Orient Express]] ([[Pat Tanaka]] and [[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Akio Sato]]) to the WWF. Orient Express got involved in a feud with [[The Rockers]] ([[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Marty Jannetty]]), whom The Orient Express defeated by count out (thanks to Sato throwing the salt in Janetty's eyes) at [[WrestleMania VI|Wrestlemania VI]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Orient Express got involved in Demolition's feud with [[The Road Warriors|the Legion of Doom]] ([[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]] and [[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]]).<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Fuji reunited with Demolition (who by this time had a third member, [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]]) at that point. Demolition was phased out while the Orient Express took on Legion of Doom in matches.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Fuji then managed [[John Nord|The Berzerker]] in late 1991 until early 1993. His last match in WWF was teaming with [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] as they lost to [[The Undertaker]] in a handicap match on July 26, 1992 at a house show.\n\nFuji's greatest success and popularity as a manager came in November 1992 when he introduced the mammoth [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] to the WWF. Under Fuji's tutelage, Yokozuna won the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble match]] and two [[WWE Championship|WWF World Championships]], first from [[Bret Hart]] at [[WrestleMania IX]], and again from [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[King of the Ring#1993|King of the Ring]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Later that year, Fuji was joined by \"spokesman\" [[Jim Cornette|James E. Cornette]]. In late 1993, Fuji once again began managing Crush after he turned on [[Randy Savage]]. During this time he again changed his appearance, abandoning the tuxedo and bowler hat in favor of a traditional Japanese [[kimono]] and [[Flag of Japan|carrying the Japanese flag]].\n\nFuji was last seen accompanying Yokozuna to the ring for a six-man tag team match involving Yokozuna against \"Camp Cornette\" at [[WrestleMania XII]]. By this point Yokozuna had fired Cornette and became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]]; Fuji joined him in the endeavor, even carrying the American flag at times. Fuji left the WWF shortly after and retired from the pro wrestling business.\n\n====Return to Wrestling (2004)====\nOn August 4, 2004, Fuji returned to wrestling at the age of 70. He wrestled his first match since 1992 where he teamed with Demolition Krash as they lost to the Titus Brothers (Timmy and Tommy) at Blue Water Championship Wrestling in Chesaning, Michigan. This would be Fuji's final match.\n\n==Retirement==\n[[File:Flickr - simononly - WWE Fan Axxess - Classic Memorabilia-Ring Gear (24).jpg|thumb|Mr. Fuji's attire at [[WrestleMania Axxess]]]]\nAfter leaving wrestling, Fujiwara retired to the city of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].

In a brief angle, Fuji turned on Chung Lee in a match at the Philadelphia Spectrum against [[The Wild Samoans]] in 1984. In a grudge match to settle the feud, Fuji defeated Chung Lee. Afterward, Fuji continued to wrestle on his own until his in-ring retirement and Chung Lee remained as a preliminary jobber.\n\n====Managerial career (1985\u20131996)====\n[[File:Mr Fuji.jpg|thumb|right|Mr Fuji as the manager of [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]], wearing their face paint]]\nFuji retired from wrestling in 1985 and became a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] and wrestled occasionally. As a manager, Fuji would \"blind\" his opponents by throwing salt in their eyes, or he or his wrestler(s) would hit their opponent with his ever-present cane. He wore a black tuxedo and bowler hat, akin to the [[James Bond]] series character [[Oddjob]], and would carry a little bag of salt on his person. His first client was [[George Steele]]. Fuji would team up with Steele and would lose to [[Hulk Hogan]] & \"Mean\" [[Gene Okerlund]] with Okerlund pinning Fuji.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/><ref name=\"Hall of Fame\"/> However, Steele would go on to [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|become]] a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] and left Fuji. Fuji's next client was [[Don Muraco]]. They both formed a popular heel duo and appeared in a [[List of professional wrestling terms#V|video package]] called \"Fuji Vice\", which was a mockery of ''[[Miami Vice]]''. Fuji and Muraco then began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ricky Steamboat]], resulting in Steamboat defeating Fuji in several matches during the feud. Fuji briefly managed [[Jim Neidhart]], whose contract he later sold to [[Jimmy Hart]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> In 1987, he bought the contract of [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) from [[John L. Sullivan (wrestler)|Luscious Johnny V]]. Demolition would sometimes call Fuji \"Master Fuji\" and he then managed Demolition to the Tag Team Championship. Fuji was also known for bringing [[Killer Khan]] and [[Sika Anoa\u02bbi|Sika]] back to the WWF.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Fuji would also acquire Kamala from [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Wizard]] managing him both in singles as well as in a tag team with Sika, and also simultaneously managed [[Bob Orton Jr.|\"Cowboy\" Bob Orton]] (whom he would often have team with Muraco, his other client).\n\nAt [[Survivor Series (1988)|Survivor Series]], he turned on Demolition and began managing Demolition's rival tag team, [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Warlord (wrestler)|Warlord]] and [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|Barbarian]]).<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Interviewed after the contest, Fuji claimed that he had turned on Demolition because, since winning the championship, they had become insubordinate and disrespectful towards him, whereas the Powers would be utterly obedient and loyal apprentices. For their part, Demolition denounced their former manager as a parasite, labelling him \"Fuj the Stooge.\"\n\nAt [[WrestleMania V]], Fuji teamed with the Powers of Pain in a 3-on-2 [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] against Demolition for their Tag Team Championship. Fuji and Powers were defeated after Ax pinned Fuji following a Demolition Decapitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm5/results/|title=WrestleMania V official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=August 28, 2008}}</ref> Fuji sold the individual contracts of Powers of Pain to [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] and [[Bobby Heenan]] and brought [[The Orient Express]] ([[Pat Tanaka]] and [[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Akio Sato]]) to the WWF. Orient Express got involved in a feud with [[The Rockers]] ([[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Marty Jannetty]]), whom The Orient Express defeated by count out (thanks to Sato throwing the salt in Janetty's eyes) at [[WrestleMania VI|Wrestlemania VI]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Orient Express got involved in Demolition's feud with [[The Road Warriors|the Legion of Doom]] ([[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]] and [[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]]).<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Fuji reunited with Demolition (who by this time had a third member, [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]]) at that point. Demolition was phased out while the Orient Express took on Legion of Doom in matches.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Fuji then managed [[John Nord|The Berzerker]] in late 1991 until early 1993. His last match in WWF was teaming with [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] as they lost to [[The Undertaker]] in a handicap match on July 26, 1992 at a house show.\n\nFuji's greatest success and popularity as a manager came in November 1992 when he introduced the mammoth [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] to the WWF. Under Fuji's tutelage, Yokozuna won the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble match]] and two [[WWE Championship|WWF World Championships]], first from [[Bret Hart]] at [[WrestleMania IX]], and again from [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[King of the Ring#1993|King of the Ring]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> Later that year, Fuji was joined by \"spokesman\" [[Jim Cornette|James E. Cornette]]. In late 1993, Fuji once again began managing Crush after he turned on [[Randy Savage]]. During this time he again changed his appearance, abandoning the tuxedo and bowler hat in favor of a traditional Japanese [[kimono]] and [[Flag of Japan|carrying the Japanese flag]].\n\nFuji was last seen accompanying Yokozuna to the ring for a six-man tag team match involving Yokozuna against \"Camp Cornette\" at [[WrestleMania XII]]. By this point Yokozuna had fired Cornette and became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]]; Fuji joined him in the endeavor, even carrying the American flag at times. Fuji left the WWF shortly after and retired from the pro wrestling business.\n\n====Return to Wrestling (2004)====\nOn August 4, 2004, Fuji returned to wrestling at the age of 70. He wrestled his first match since 1992 where he teamed with Demolition Krash as they lost to the Titus Brothers (Timmy and Tommy) at Blue Water Championship Wrestling in Chesaning, Michigan. This would be Fuji's final match.\n\n==Retirement==\n[[File:Flickr - simononly - WWE Fan Axxess - Classic Memorabilia-Ring Gear (24).jpg|thumb|Mr. Fuji's attire at [[WrestleMania Axxess]]]]\nAfter leaving wrestling, Fujiwara retired to the city of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].

It was [[championship unification|unified]] with the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], which WWE recognized as the \"Unified WWE Tag Team Championship\". On August 16, 2010, the World Tag Team Championship was decommissioned in favor of continuing the lineage of the WWE Tag Team Championship.\n\nSome reigns were held by champions using a [[ring name]], while others used their [[Personal name|real name]]. There have been a total of 113 recognized teams and 164 recognized individual champions, who have had a combined 176 official reigns. The first champions were [[Luke Graham (wrestler)|Luke Graham]] and [[Camille Tourville|Tarzan Tyler]] and the final champions were [[The Hart Dynasty]] ([[David Hart Smith]] and [[Tyson Kidd]]).\n\nThe team with the most reigns is [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]]) with eight. [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] has the most individual reigns with twelve.
