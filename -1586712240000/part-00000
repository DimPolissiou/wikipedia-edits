Although Balbi currently competes in the [[light welterweight]] division, he is most notable for having won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[List of lightweight boxing champions|world lightweight title]].\n\n==Professional career==\nBalbi made his professional debut on November 19, 1993 in [[Mercedes, Corrientes]], Argentina. Balbi made a victorious start to his career by [[knockout|knocking out]] Juan Bautista Sosa in the first round. One of the highlights of Balbi's early career came on June 3, 1995 when he beat Simon Canache to claim the [[South America]]n lightweight title. The first loss of Balbi's career came on September 9, 1995 when he lost to Manuel Alberto Billalba via a ten round points decision, Balbi avenged this defeat later on in his career by beating Billalba twice.\n\nOn February 22, 1997 Balbi travelled to [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] to challenge the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] champion [[Artur Grigorian]] for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] lightweight title. Balbi's challenge proved to be unsuccessful, as Grigorian scored an eleventh round technical knockout. After the fight Balbi returned to Argentina, where he put together a run of five wins before losing a split decision to Walter Hugo Rodriguez.<ref name=boxrec>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?cat=boxer&human_id=11432|title=boxer: Raul Horacio Balbi| publisher= Boxrec|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nBalbi remained undefeated over his next sixteen bouts, earning him a chance to fight Alberto Esteban Sicurella in a WBA title eliminator. Balbi won the fight by tenth round technical knockout, which led to a world title challenge against the [[France|French]] champion [[Julien Lorcy]] on October 8, 2001 in [[Paris]]. In the third round of the contest Balbi was able to open a large cut above the champion's right eye and had further success when he knocked Lorcy down in the seventh. The fight lasted the twelve round distance and Balbi was announced as the winner via a majority decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kJQVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mQsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3764,1049416&dq=balbi+lorcy&hl=en|title=Balbi takes lightweight title from Lorcy by majority decision, Manila Standard - Oct 10, 2001|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first defence of Balbi's title took place on January 5, 2002 against [[Leonard Dorin]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. After a toe-to-toe battle which lasted the full twelve rounds, the [[Romania]]n challenger Dorin was announced the winner by split decision. After the fight a surprised Balbi claimed that he was \"robbed\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing-title-goes-to-dorin-in-bruising-contest-662381.html|title=Boxing: Title goes to Dorin in bruising contest| publisher= The Independent|accessdate=28 May 2010 | location=London | first=Ken | last=Mannion | date=7 January 2002}}</ref> A rematch occurred five months later, this time in [[Bucharest]], Romania. On this occasion Dorin won a unanimous decision with scores of: 118-111, 117-112 and 118-110.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-53345738.html|title=Article: Box: Romanian Doroftei retains WBA title on points | publisher= AAP Sports News (Australia)|accessdate=28 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nA run of six consecutive wins earned Balbi another shot at the WBA title, this time for the vacant light welterweight belt. The fight took place in [[Bolton]], [[United Kingdom]] on September 2, 2006, against the Frenchman [[Souleymane M'baye]]. Balbi was knocked down twice en route to a fourth round loss via technical knockout, thus handing the title to M'baye.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxnews.com.ua/en/news/2848/2006-09-03/MBaye-claims-vacant-WBA-crown|title=M'Baye claims vacant WBA crown | publisher= BOXNEWS|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> Since his light welterweight title challenge Balbi has lost three times.

Although Balbi currently competes in the [[light welterweight]] division, he is most notable for having won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[List of lightweight boxing champions|world lightweight title]].\n\n==Professional career==\nBalbi made his professional debut on November 19, 1993 in [[Mercedes, Corrientes]], Argentina. Balbi made a victorious start to his career by [[knockout|knocking out]] Juan Bautista Sosa in the first round. One of the highlights of Balbi's early career came on June 3, 1995 when he beat Simon Canache to claim the [[South America]]n lightweight title. The first loss of Balbi's career came on September 9, 1995 when he lost to Manuel Alberto Billalba via a ten round points decision, Balbi avenged this defeat later on in his career by beating Billalba twice.\n\nOn February 22, 1997 Balbi travelled to [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] to challenge the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] champion [[Artur Grigorian]] for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] lightweight title. Balbi's challenge proved to be unsuccessful, as Grigorian scored an eleventh round technical knockout. After the fight Balbi returned to Argentina, where he put together a run of five wins before losing a split decision to Walter Hugo Rodriguez.<ref name=boxrec>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?cat=boxer&human_id=11432|title=boxer: Raul Horacio Balbi| publisher= Boxrec|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nBalbi remained undefeated over his next sixteen bouts, earning him a chance to fight Alberto Esteban Sicurella in a WBA title eliminator. Balbi won the fight by tenth round technical knockout, which led to a world title challenge against the [[France|French]] champion [[Julien Lorcy]] on October 8, 2001 in [[Paris]]. In the third round of the contest Balbi was able to open a large cut above the champion's right eye and had further success when he knocked Lorcy down in the seventh. The fight lasted the twelve round distance and Balbi was announced as the winner via a majority decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kJQVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mQsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3764,1049416&dq=balbi+lorcy&hl=en|title=Balbi takes lightweight title from Lorcy by majority decision, Manila Standard - Oct 10, 2001|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first defence of Balbi's title took place on January 5, 2002 against [[Leonard Dorin]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. After a toe-to-toe battle which lasted the full twelve rounds, the [[Romania]]n challenger Dorin was announced the winner by split decision. After the fight a surprised Balbi claimed that he was \"robbed\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing-title-goes-to-dorin-in-bruising-contest-662381.html|title=Boxing: Title goes to Dorin in bruising contest| publisher= The Independent|accessdate=28 May 2010 | location=London | first=Ken | last=Mannion | date=7 January 2002}}</ref> A rematch occurred five months later, this time in [[Bucharest]], Romania.

The fight took place in [[Bolton]], [[United Kingdom]] on September 2, 2006, against the Frenchman [[Souleymane M'baye]]. Balbi was knocked down twice en route to a fourth round loss via technical knockout, thus handing the title to M'baye.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxnews.com.ua/en/news/2848/2006-09-03/MBaye-claims-vacant-WBA-crown|title=M'Baye claims vacant WBA crown | publisher= BOXNEWS|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> Since his light welterweight title challenge Balbi has lost three times.

The 73's are members of the [[Provincial Junior Hockey League]] and the [[Ontario Hockey Association]].  Prior to becoming members of the PJHL in 2016 the 73's won the [[Great Lakes Junior Hockey League|GLJHL]] playoff championship 20 times and the [[Clarence Schmalz Cup]] as Provincial Junior C Champions 7 times.\n\n==History==\nThe Essex 73's have competed in the [[Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League]] since the 1973\u201374 season. In total, the club has won 20 Great Lakes Junior C League Championships and 7 All-Ontario Junior C titles. By both measures, they are the most successful team in Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League history. Their 7 [[Clarence Schmalz Cup]] (CSC) wins and 14 CSC finals appearances are both Ontario Junior C records.\n[[File:Essex 73s goalie 2012.JPG|left|thumbnail|200px|Essex goalie warming up during 2012 playoffs.]]\n[[File:Essex goalie 2013 Schmalz Cup.JPG|right|225px|thumbnail|73's goalie in 40th anniversary commemorative jersey during 2013 Schmalz Cup finals.]]\nWith Dave Prpich behind the bench, the 73's won four league titles in a row from 1974\u20131975 to 1977\u20131978, including three All-Ontario Championships in that span.  The 73's would claim two more Great Lakes League Championships in the 1980s in 1985\u20131986 and 1986\u20131987.\n\nAfter some struggles in the early to mid-1990s, the 73's got back into winning form, taking the title for the first time in ten years. In 1997\u20131998 the team won the Great Lakes League Championship by defeating the [[Wallaceburg Lakers]] in the league final. Their loss to the [[Kincardine Bulldogs]] in the All-Ontario semifinals marked the 73's most successful season in a decade.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, general manager Al Lemay brought aboard head coach [[Tony Piroski]], who coached the team from 2001 to 2010. The 73's had great success under Piroski, and in his first season the 73's won the Great Lakes League and the All-Ontario Title, defeating the [[Uxbridge Bruins]] in the finals.\n\nOn September 27, 2003, 19-year-old forward Glen Ivancic was fatally stabbed in Windsor. A banner #25 hung from the rafters at the [[Essex Memorial Arena]] for years before it was given to his parents.\n\nThe team reached the All-Ontario Junior C Finals five straight seasons (tying an Ontario Junior C Record), defeating the [[Grimsby Peach Kings]] in 2005 but losing to the [[Penetang Kings]] in 2006 and 2007. In 2008 they faced the offensive powerhouse [[Alliston Hornets]] and were defeated in a memorable game 7 overtime loss in Essex. The 2008\u20132009 season saw the 73's finish with a remarkable 59 wins, 1 overtime loss, 1 regulation loss, and 1 shoot-out loss (including play-offs). The team finished with 31 wins and 0 losses at home in their final season in the historic [[Essex Memorial Arena]]. The 73's returned to the finals in 2009 to face [[Alliston Hornets|Alliston]] for the second straight year and the 73's fifth consecutive Clarence Schmalz Cup Finals appearance. Essex overwhelmed Alliston on their way to a four-game sweep to win the provincial title. In nine seasons under Piroski the 73's won 7 Great Lakes League Championships and claimed the Clarence Schmalz Cup 3 times as All-Ontario Champions.\n\nThe 73's re-hired Les Garrod to the team in the 2010\u201311 season; the team would finish 2nd place to the Belle River Canadiens and go out in the first round to the Wheatley Sharks in 7 games. It would be the first time in 15 years (1996\u201397) that the team did not make it out of the First round. Garrod and staff resigned at the end of the season.\n\nThe 73's brought aboard former Windsor Spitfire Scott Miller for the 2011 season as the club's general manager and hired former Lasalle Vipers assistant Gil Langois as head coach. This tandem delivered four consecutive Great Lakes League Championships and three Clarence Schmalz Cup Finals appearances, including one OHA Junior C Championship. In 2013 the 73's swept both [[Ayr Centennials|Ayr]] and the familiar Niagara champion [[Grimsby Peach Kings|Grimsby]] before losing in the CSC finals 4 games to 1 to the [[Picton Pirates]]. 2014 featured a more difficult road to the CSC finals with a high-scoring 7-game quarterfinal against [[Dorchester Dolphins|Dorchester]] along with a 5-game semifinal victory over the Western League champion [[Wingham Ironmen]] before the 73's were swept in the Schmalz Cup finals by the [[Lakefield Chiefs]]. In 2015 the 73's defeated [[Exeter Hawks|Exeter]] in four games and [[Ayr Centennials|Ayr]] in five qualifying for their third straight CSC appearance. In three closely contested games versus the Empire B champion [[Port Hope Panthers]], the 73's built up a 3\u20130 series lead, but the Panthers stormed back, winning the next three games, setting up a winner-take-all game 7 in Port Hope. A lone second-period goal was the difference between the teams as the 73's clinched their seventh [[Clarence Schmalz Cup|CSC]] All-Ontario Championship and first since 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 the eight junior \"C\" leagues amalgamated under the [[Provincial Junior Hockey League|Provincial]], and the GLJHL became the Bill Stobbs Division of the new league. The PJHL league champions will become the [[Clarence Schmalz Cup|CSC]] All-Ontario Champions.\n\nIn 2017-2018, the Essex 73's streak of 6 straight League Championships came to an end as the Lakeshore Canadiens defeated the 73's in 5 games in the Stobbs Division Finals. The Canadiens were coached by former 73's player and coach Anthony Iaquinta.\n\n2018-2019 saw Gil Langlois return as Head Coach of the 73's and guided the 73's to a First Place finish.  The 73's would sweep their first 2 rounds against the Petrolia Flyers and Amherstburg Admirals setting up a rematch against the Lakeshore Canadiens in the division Finals.

The 73's are members of the [[Provincial Junior Hockey League]] and the [[Ontario Hockey Association]].  Prior to becoming members of the PJHL in 2016 the 73's won the [[Great Lakes Junior Hockey League|GLJHL]] playoff championship 20 times and the [[Clarence Schmalz Cup]] as Provincial Junior C Champions 7 times.\n\n==History==\nThe Essex 73's have competed in the [[Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League]] since the 1973\u201374 season. In total, the club has won 20 Great Lakes Junior C League Championships and 7 All-Ontario Junior C titles. By both measures, they are the most successful team in Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League history. Their 7 [[Clarence Schmalz Cup]] (CSC) wins and 14 CSC finals appearances are both Ontario Junior C records.\n[[File:Essex 73s goalie 2012.JPG|left|thumbnail|200px|Essex goalie warming up during 2012 playoffs.]]\n[[File:Essex goalie 2013 Schmalz Cup.JPG|right|225px|thumbnail|73's goalie in 40th anniversary commemorative jersey during 2013 Schmalz Cup finals.]]\nWith Dave Prpich behind the bench, the 73's won four league titles in a row from 1974\u201375 to 1977-78, including three All-Ontario Championships in that span.  The 73's would claim two more Great Lakes League Championships in the 1980s in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387.\n\nAfter some struggles in the early to mid-1990s, the 73's got back into winning form, taking the title for the first time in ten years. In 1997\u201398 the team won the Great Lakes League Championship by defeating the [[Wallaceburg Lakers]] in the league final. Their loss to the [[Kincardine Bulldogs]] in the All-Ontario semifinals marked the 73's most successful season in a decade.\n\nIn the 2001\u201302 season general manager Al Lemay brought aboard head coach [[Tony Piroski]], who coached the team from 2001 to 2010. The 73's had great success under Piroski, and in his first season the 73's won the Great Lakes League and the All-Ontario Title, defeating the [[Uxbridge Bruins]] in the finals.\n\nOn September 27, 2003, 19-year-old forward Glen Ivancic was fatally stabbed in Windsor. A banner #25 hung from the rafters at the [[Essex Memorial Arena]] for years before it was given to his parents.\n\nThe team reached the All-Ontario Junior C Finals five straight seasons (tying an Ontario Junior C Record), defeating the [[Grimsby Peach Kings]] in 2005 but losing to the [[Penetang Kings]] in 2006 and 2007. In 2008 they faced the offensive powerhouse [[Alliston Hornets]] and were defeated in a memorable game 7 overtime loss in Essex. The 2008\u201309 season saw the 73's finish with a remarkable 59 wins, 1 overtime loss, 1 regulation loss, and 1 shoot-out loss (including play-offs). The team finished with 31 wins and 0 losses at home in their final season in the historic [[Essex Memorial Arena]]. The 73's returned to the finals in 2009 to face [[Alliston Hornets|Alliston]] for the second straight year and the 73's fifth consecutive Clarence Schmalz Cup Finals appearance. Essex overwhelmed Alliston on their way to a four-game sweep to win the provincial title. In nine seasons under Piroski the 73's won 7 Great Lakes League Championships and claimed the Clarence Schmalz Cup 3 times as All-Ontario Champions.\n\nThe 73's re-hired Les Garrod to the team in the 2010\u201311 season; the team would finish 2nd place to the Belle River Canadiens and go out in the first round to the Wheatley Sharks in 7 games. It would be the first time in 15 years (1996\u201397) that the team did not make it out of the First round. Garrod and staff resigned at the end of the season.\n\nThe 73's brought aboard former Windsor Spitfire Scott Miller for the 2011 season as the club's general manager and hired former Lasalle Vipers assistant Gil Langois as head coach. This tandem delivered four consecutive Great Lakes League Championships and three Clarence Schmalz Cup Finals appearances, including one OHA Junior C Championship. In 2013 the 73's swept both [[Ayr Centennials|Ayr]] and the familiar Niagara champion [[Grimsby Peach Kings|Grimsby]] before losing in the CSC finals 4 games to 1 to the [[Picton Pirates]]. 2014 featured a more difficult road to the CSC finals with a high-scoring 7-game quarterfinal against [[Dorchester Dolphins|Dorchester]] along with a 5-game semifinal victory over the Western League champion [[Wingham Ironmen]] before the 73's were swept in the Schmalz Cup finals by the [[Lakefield Chiefs]]. In 2015 the 73's defeated [[Exeter Hawks|Exeter]] in four games and [[Ayr Centennials|Ayr]] in five qualifying for their third straight CSC appearance. In three closely contested games versus the Empire B champion [[Port Hope Panthers]], the 73's built up a 3-0 series lead, but the Panthers stormed back, winning the next three games, setting up a winner-take-all game 7 in Port Hope. A lone second-period goal was the difference between the teams as the 73's clinched their seventh [[Clarence Schmalz Cup|CSC]] All-Ontario Championship and first since 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 the eight junior \"C\" leagues amalgamated under the [[Provincial Junior Hockey League|Provincial]], and the GLJHL became the Bill Stobbs Division of the new league. The PJHL league champions will become the [[Clarence Schmalz Cup|CSC]] All-Ontario Champions.\n\nIn 2017-2018 the Essex 73's streak of 6 straight League Championships came to an end as the Lakeshore Canadiens defeated the 73's in 5 games in the Stobbs Division Finals. The Canadiens were coached by former 73's player and coach Anthony Iaquinta.\n\n2018-2019 saw Gil Langlois return as Head Coach of the 73's and guided the 73's to a First Place finish.  The 73's would sweep their first 2 rounds against the Petrolia Flyers and Amherstburg Admirals setting up a rematch against the Lakeshore Canadiens in the division Finals.  The Canadiens would repeat as Stobbs Champions knocking off the 73's in 5 games.\n\n==General managers==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n* '''1973-74''' - [[Herb Rounding]]\n* '''1974-83'''

She is overcome with personal insecurities and professional jealousies\u2014all while sexual tension simmers between her and her personal assistant (Stewart).

The film received positive reviews, with critics lauding the work as psychologically complex and praising the lead actresses' performances. It won the [[Louis Delluc Prize]] for [[Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film|Best Film]] in December 2014, and received six [[C\u00e9sar Award]] nominations. Stewart received the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in February 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nMaria Enders ([[Juliette Binoche]]) is an international film star and stage actress. She travels with a loyal young American assistant, Valentine ([[Kristen Stewart]]). Twenty years earlier, Maria got her big break when she was cast and successfully performed as a young girl \"Sigrid\" in both the play and film versions of ''{{ill|Maloja Snake|de|Malojawind#Malojaschlange}}'' by Wilhelm Melchior, a Swiss playwright who is now elderly. The play centers on the tempestuous relationship between Sigrid and \"Helena,\" a vulnerable older woman. Helena commits suicide after Sigrid takes advantage of her, and dumps her.\n\nWhile traveling to Zurich to accept an award on behalf of Wilhelm, and planning to visit him at home the following day at his house in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] &ndash; a remote settlement in the Alps &ndash; Maria learns of his death. His widow Rosa later confides that Wilhelm had ended his life and had been terminally ill. During the awards ceremony, Maria is approached by Klaus Diesterweg, a popular theater director. He wants to persuade her to appear on stage in ''Maloja Snake'' again, but this time in the role of Helena, the older woman.\n\nMaria is torn and reluctantly accepts. To prepare for the role, she accepts Rosa's offer to stay at the Melchiors' house in Sils Maria. Rosa is leaving to escape her memories of Wilhelm. Maria's discussions with Valentine and their read-throughs of the play's scenes evoke uncertainty about the nature of their relationship. A young American actress, 19-year-old Jo-Ann Ellis ([[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]]), has been chosen to interpret the role of Sigrid. Researching her on Google and the internet, Valentine tells Maria, who is out of touch with social media, that Ellis has been involved in numerous scandals.\n\nQuestions soon multiply regarding aging, time, culture and the blurring line between the Sigrid/Helena and the Valentine/Maria relationships. Maria and Jo-Ann finally meet, but their relationship is complicated. Jo-Ann appears to be implicated in the attempted suicide of the wife of her new (and married) boyfriend.\n\nDuring their time at Sils Maria, Maria and Valentine spend much of their days hiking in the Alps. On one such final outing, they hike to the [[Maloja Pass]] &ndash; to observe a fascinating early morning cloud phenomenon that appears low in the pass (the \"Maloja Snake\" of the play's title, but also the \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" in the film's title). Valentine suggests that Helena may not commit suicide but simply walk away to start a new life. Maria protests that Helena walks into the mountains never to return and must therefore be dead. After suggesting that their approaches to the play are too different for her (Valentine) to be a useful assistant, Valentine disappears without explanation, never to reappear.\n\nA few weeks later, a young filmmaker who has previously sent a script to Maria visits her by appointment five minutes before the curtain rises on the opening night of ''Maloja Snake'' in London. Maria seems preoccupied, so near to curtain rise, and dismisses his suggested ideas about the proposed film role he is offering her as \"too abstract for me\". When she says the role he has written is too young for her and would suit Jo-Ann better, he suggests that the character is ageless and that he does not relate to his era with its internet scandals and trashy values. Clearly he admires her and her work. Maria does not give him a reply as to whether she will take part in the film. Then she is on stage, smoking and waiting for Sigrid.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2014 8.jpg|thumb|[[Juliette Binoche]], [[Olivier Assayas]], and [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] promoting the film at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Maria Enders\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Valentine\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Jo-Ann Ellis\n* [[Joe Flynn (UK actor)|Johnny Flynn]] as Christopher Giles\n* [[Lars Eidinger]] as Klaus Diesterweg\n* [[Hanns Zischler]] as Henryk Wald<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/daniel-bruhl-bruno-ganz-more-join-olivier-assayas-sils-maria-with-juliette-binoche-chloe-moretz-kristen-stewart-20130820|title=Daniel Bruhl, Bruno Ganz & More Join Olivier Assayas' 'Sils Maria' With Juliette Binoche, Chloe Moretz & Kristen Stewart|first=Kevin|last=Jagernauth|website=[[IndieWire]]|date=20 August 2013|accessdate=6 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105052108/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/daniel-bruhl-bruno-ganz-more-join-olivier-assayas-sils-maria-with-juliette-binoche-chloe-moretz-kristen-stewart-20130820|archive-date=5 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Piers Roaldson\n* Aljoscha Stadelmann as Urs Kobler\n* Benoit Peverelli as Berndt\n* Luise Berndt as Nelly\n* [[Angela Winkler]] as Rosa Melchior\n* [[Gilles Tschudi]] as Mayor of Zurich\n* Caroline de Maigret as [[Chanel]] Press Attache\n* Claire Tran as Maria's London Assistant (Mei-Ling)\n* Jakob Kohn as Jo-Ann's manager\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] of ''Clouds of Sils Maria'' began on 22 August 2013 and ended on 4 October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.crew-united.com/|title=Clouds of Sils Maria (2013-2014)|website=Crew United|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> The film was shot on location in the titular village of [[Sils Maria]], Switzerland as well as Zurich; Leipzig, Germany; and South Tyrol, Italy.\n\nIn an interview, Olivier Assayas said that all the film's interiors were shot in Germany.

She is overcome with personal insecurities and professional jealousies\u2014all while sexual tension simmers between her and her personal assistant (Stewart).

The film received positive reviews, with critics lauding the work as psychologically complex and praising the lead actresses' performances. It won the [[Louis Delluc Prize]] for [[Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film|Best Film]] in December 2014, and received six [[C\u00e9sar Award]] nominations. Stewart received the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in February 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nMaria Enders ([[Juliette Binoche]]) is an international film star and stage actress. She travels with a loyal young American assistant, Valentine ([[Kristen Stewart]]). Twenty years earlier, Maria got her big break when she was cast and successfully performed as a young girl \"Sigrid\" in both the play and film versions of ''{{ill|Maloja Snake|de|Malojawind#Malojaschlange}}'' by Wilhelm Melchior, a Swiss playwright who is now elderly. The play centers on the tempestuous relationship between Sigrid and \"Helena,\" a vulnerable older woman. Helena commits suicide after Sigrid takes advantage of her, and dumps her.\n\nWhile traveling to Zurich to accept an award on behalf of Wilhelm, and planning to visit him at home the following day at his house in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] &ndash; a remote settlement in the Alps &ndash; Maria learns of his death. His widow Rosa later confides that Wilhelm had ended his life and had been terminally ill. During the awards ceremony, Maria is approached by Klaus Diesterweg, a popular theater director. He wants to persuade her to appear on stage in ''Maloja Snake'' again, but this time in the role of Helena, the older woman.\n\nMaria is torn and reluctantly accepts. To prepare for the role, she accepts Rosa's offer to stay at the Melchiors' house in Sils Maria. Rosa is leaving to escape her memories of Wilhelm. Maria's discussions with Valentine and their read-throughs of the play's scenes evoke uncertainty about the nature of their relationship. A young American actress, 19-year-old Jo-Ann Ellis ([[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]]), has been chosen to interpret the role of Sigrid. Researching her on Google and the internet, Valentine tells Maria, who is out of touch with social media, that Ellis has been involved in numerous scandals.\n\nQuestions soon multiply regarding aging, time, culture and the blurring line between the Sigrid/Helena and the Valentine/Maria relationships. Maria and Jo-Ann finally meet, but their relationship is complicated. Jo-Ann appears to be implicated in the attempted suicide of the wife of her new (and married) boyfriend.\n\nDuring their time at Sils Maria, Maria and Valentine spend much of their days hiking in the Alps. On one such final outing, they hike to the [[Maloja Pass]] &ndash; to observe a fascinating early morning cloud phenomenon that appears low in the pass (the \"Maloja Snake\" of the play's title, but also the \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" in the film's title). Valentine suggests that Helena may not commit suicide but simply walk away to start a new life. Maria protests that Helena walks into the mountains never to return and must therefore be dead. After suggesting that their approaches to the play are too different for her (Valentine) to be a useful assistant, a disconsolate Valentine disappears without explanation, never to reappear.\n\nA few weeks later, a young filmmaker who has previously sent a script to Maria visits her by appointment five minutes before the curtain rises on the opening night of ''Maloja Snake'' in London. Maria seems preoccupied, so near to curtain rise, and dismisses his suggested ideas about the proposed film role he is offering her as \"too abstract for me\".

In the 1990s, 3D-printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes and a more appropriate term for it was [[rapid prototyping]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmg-muenchen.de/training-course/11/Additive-Manufacturing?flang=en|title=Learning Course: Additive Manufacturing \u2013 Additive Fertigung|website=tmg-muenchen.de}}</ref> {{As of|2019}}, the precision, repeatability, and material range have increased to the point that some 3D-printing processes are considered viable as an industrial-production technology, whereby the term '''additive manufacturing''' can be used synonymously with \"3D printing\". One of the key advantages of 3D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries, and a prerequisite for producing any 3D printed part is a digital [[3D modeling|3D model]] or a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] file.\n\nThe most-commonly used 3D-printing process (46% {{as of|2018|lc=on}}) is a material extrusion technique called [[Fused filament fabrication#Fused deposition modeling|fused deposition modeling]] (FDM).<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.statista.com/statistics/560304/worldwide-survey-3d-printing-top-technologies/|title= Most used 3D printing technologies 2017\u20132018 {{!}} Statistic|website= Statista|language= en|access-date= 2 December 2018}}</ref> While FDM technology was invented after the other two most popular technologies, stereolithography (SLA) and selective laser sintering (SLS), FDM is typically the most inexpensive of the three by a large margin, which lends to the popularity of the process.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe [[umbrella term]] ''additive manufacturing (AM)'' gained popularity in the 2000s,<ref name=\"Ngram_additive_manufacturing\" /> inspired by the theme of material being added together ([[3D printing processes|in any of various ways]]). In contrast, the term ''subtractive manufacturing'' appeared as a [[retronym]] for the large family of [[machining]] processes with material ''removal'' as their common theme. The term ''3D printing'' still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds, and the term ''AM'' was more likely to be used in metalworking and end use part production contexts than among polymer, ink-jet, or stereo lithography enthusiasts.\n\nBy early 2010s, the terms ''3D printing'' and ''additive manufacturing'' evolved [[word sense|senses]] in which they were alternate umbrella terms for additive technologies, one being used in popular language by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial end-use part producers, machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term ''3D printing'' has been associated with machines low in price or in capability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/69669.html|title=ISO/ASTM 52900:2015 \u2013 Additive manufacturing \u2013 General principles \u2013 Terminology|website=iso.org|language=en|access-date=15 June 2017}}</ref> ''3D printing'' and ''additive manufacturing'' reflect that the technologies share the theme of material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of ''Additive Manufacturing'' magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often [[synonym]]ous in casual usage<ref name=\"Zelinski_2017-08-04\">{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=4 August 2017 |title=Additive manufacturing and 3D printing are two different things |journal=Additive Manufacturing |url=http://www.additivemanufacturing.media/columns/additive-manufacturing-and-3d-printing-are-two-different-things |accessdate=11 August 2017 |postscript=.}}</ref> but some manufacturing industry experts are trying to make a distinction whereby Additive Manufacturing [[hyponymy and hypernymy|comprises]] 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a [[manufacturing process]].<ref name=\"Zelinski_2017-08-04\" />\n\nOther terms that have been used as synonyms or [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hypernyms]] have included ''desktop manufacturing'', ''rapid manufacturing'' (as the logical production-level successor to ''[[rapid prototyping]]''), and ''on-demand manufacturing'' (which echoes ''[[print on demand|on-demand printing]]'' in the 2D sense of ''printing''). Such application of the adjectives ''rapid'' and ''on-demand'' to the noun ''manufacturing'' was novel in the 2000s reveals the prevailing [[mental model]] of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long [[lead time]]s for laborious tooling development. Today, the term ''subtractive'' has not replaced the term ''machining'', instead [[wikt:complement#Verb|complementing]] it when a term that covers any removal method is needed. [[Agile tooling]] is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick [[Prototype|prototyping]] and responses to tooling and fixture needs.

Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object.<ref name=\"Auto3D-7\" /> Others sometimes use standard, off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype. The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed, costs of the 3D printer, of the printed prototype, choice and cost of the materials, and color capabilities.<ref name=\"Auto3D-8\" /> Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive. However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold, which is then used to make metal parts.<ref name=\"Auto3D-9\" />\n\nISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes within its meaning: binder jetting, directed energy deposition, material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion, sheet lamination, and vat photopolymerization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/ISOASTM52900.htm|title=Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing \u2013 General Principles \u2013 Terminology|date=1 December 2015|website=ASTM International \u2013 Standards Worldwide|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers. In [[Fused filament fabrication]], also known as [[Fused deposition modeling]] (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of [[thermoplastic]], metal wire, or other material is fed into an [[extrusion]] nozzle head ([[3D printer extruder]]), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Selective Heat Sintering Works |url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/powder-bed-fusion/selective-heat-sintering-shs |publisher=THRE3D.com |accessdate=3 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203071153/https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/powder-bed-fusion/selective-heat-sintering-shs |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref> Recently, FFF/FDM has expanded to 3-D print directly from pellets to avoid the conversion to filament.

Powder Bed Fusion processes can be used with an array of materials and their flexibility allows for geometrically complex structures,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://make.3dexperience.3ds.com/processes/powder-bed-fusion|title=Powder Bed Fusion processes|website=|access-date=}}</ref> making it a go to choice for many 3D printing projects. These techniques include [[selective laser sintering]], with both metals and polymers, and [[direct metal laser sintering]].<ref name=\"DMLS\" /> [[Selective laser melting]] does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals. [[Electron beam melting]] is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. [[titanium alloy]]s). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum.<ref name=\"Auto3D-12\" /><ref name=\"Auto3D-13\" /> Another method consists of an [[Powder bed and inkjet head 3D printing|inkjet 3D printing]] system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder ([[plaster]], or [[resin]]s) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With [[laminated object manufacturing]], thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. In addition to the previously mentioned methods, [[HP Inc.|HP]] has developed the Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) which is a powder base technique, though no laser are involved. An inkjet array applies fusing and detailing agents which are then combined by heating to create a solid layer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://make.3dexperience.3ds.com/processes/material-extrusion|title=Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) by HP|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[File:Schematic representation of Stereolithography.png|thumb|upright|Schematic representation of Stereolithography; a light-emitting device ''a)'' (laser or DLP) selectively illuminate the transparent bottom ''c)'' of a tank ''b)'' filled with a liquid photo-polymerizing resin; the solidified resin ''d)'' is progressively dragged up by a lifting platform ''e)'']] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as [[stereolithography]].

Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in [[two-photon absorption|multiphoton]] photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100&nbsp;nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts.<ref name=\"Auto3D-15\" /> Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using [[LED]]s.<ref name=\"Auto3D-16\" />\n\nIn Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes.

These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between human and robot is inevitable. The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices, post processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until maturity of the fabrication is achieved. Instead of the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Thus, 3D printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionise the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical, functional, and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external [[joint]]s, [[adhesive]]s, and [[fastener]]s.\nCircuit board manufacturing involves multiple steps which include imaging, drilling, plating, soldermask coating, nomenclature printing and surface finishes. These steps include many chemicals such as harsh solvents and acids. 3D printing circuit boards remove the need for many of these steps while still producing complex designs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shortsleeveandtieclub.com/3d-printed-circuit-boards-are-the-next-big-thing-in-additive-manufacturing/|title=3D Printed Circuit Boards are the Next Big Thing in Additive Manufacturing|date=20 June 2018}}</ref> Polymer ink is used to create the layers of the build while silver polymer is used for creating the traces and holes used to allow electricity to flow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nano-di.com/materials|title=Additive Manufacturing Inks & Materials for Custom 3D Printing Solutions|first=Nano|last=Dimension|website=nano-di.com}}</ref> Current circuit board manufacturing can be a tedious process depending on the design. Specified materials are gathered and sent into inner layer processing where images are printed, developed and etched. The etches cores are typically punched to add lamination tooling. The cores are then prepared for lamination. The stack-up, the buildup of a circuit board, is built and sent into lamination where the layers are bonded. The boards are then measured and drilled. Many steps may differ from this stage however for simple designs, the material goes through a plating process to plate the holes and surface. The outer image is then printed, developed and etched. After the image is defined, the material must get coated with soldermask for later soldering. Nomenclature is then added so components can be identified later. Then the surface finish is added. The boards are routed out of panel form into their singular or array form and then electrically tested. Aside from the paperwork which must be completed which proves the boards meet specifications, the boards are then packed and shipped. The benefits of 3D printing would be that the final outline is defined from the beginning, no imaging, punching or lamination is required and electrical connections are made with the silver polymer which eliminates drilling and plating. The final paperwork would also be greatly reduced due to the lack of materials required to build the circuit board. Complex designs which may takes weeks to complete through normal processing can be 3D printed, greatly reducing manufacturing time.\n\n== Legal aspects ==\n\n=== Intellectual property ===\n{{See also|Free hardware}}\n3D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes, including [[patent]]s, [[industrial design right]]s, [[copyright]]s, and [[trademark]]s may apply. However, there is not much [[jurisprudence]] to say how these laws will apply if 3D printers become mainstream and individuals or hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use, for non-profit distribution, or for sale.\n\nAny of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in 3D printing, or the distribution or sale of the printed item. To be allowed to do these things, where an active intellectual property was involved, a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence, which may come with conditions and a price. However, many patent, design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for 'private', 'non-commercial' use of inventions, designs or works of art protected under intellectual property (IP). That standard limitation or exception may leave such private, non-commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights.\n\nPatents cover inventions including processes, machines, manufacturing, and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries, but generally 20 years from the date of application. Therefore, if a type of wheel is patented, printing, using, or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-82\" />\n\nCopyright covers an expression<ref name=\"wired\" /> in a tangible, fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus 70&nbsp;years thereafter.<ref name=\"deal\" /> If someone makes a statue, they may have a copyright mark on the appearance of that statue, so if someone sees that statue, they cannot then distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue.\n\nWhen a feature has both artistic (copyrightable) and functional (patentable) merits, when the question has appeared in US court, the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item.<ref name=\"deal\" /> In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of unauthorized copying, only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent.\n\n=== Gun legislation and administration ===\n{{Main|3D printed firearms}}\nThe US [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[Joint Regional Intelligence Center]] released a memo stating that \"significant advances in three-dimensional (3D) printing capabilities, availability of free digital 3D printable files for firearms components, and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture 3D printed guns\" and that \"proposed legislation to ban 3D printing of weapons may deter, but cannot completely prevent, their production. Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation, online distribution of these 3D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music, movie or software files.\"<ref name=\"AutoSQ-83\" /> Currently, it is not prohibited by law to manufacture firearms for personal use in the United States, as long as the firearm is not produced with the intent to be sold or transferred, and meets a few basic requirements. A license is required to manufacture firearms for sale or distribution. The law prohibits a person from assembling a non\u2013sporting semiautomatic rifle or shotgun from 10 or more imported parts, as well as firearms that cannot be detected by metal detectors or x\u2013ray machines.

These post-processing activities can include chemical baths, sanding, polishing, or vapor exposure to refine surface finish, as well as general [[Machining|subtractive manufacturing]] techniques such as drilling, milling, or turning to modify the printed geometry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fictiv.com/hwg/fabricate/ultimate-guide-to-finishing-3d-printed-parts|title=Ultimate Guide to Finishing 3D Printed Parts {{!}} Fictiv \u2013 Hardware Guide|website=fictiv.com|language=en|access-date=19 October 2017}}</ref> Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used, such as respirators or safety glasses.

Advocates of [[additive manufacturing]] also predict that this arc of technological development will counter [[globalization]], as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations.<ref name=\"3D opp\" /> The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely.<ref name=\"Albert_2011-02_MMS_column\" />\n\nThe ability of additive manufacturing to convert nanoscale building blocks into high-quality prototypes in a scalable, controllable and affordable manner presents great opportunities and challenges for the next several decades.<ref name=\":3\" /> The [[futurologist]] [[Jeremy Rifkin]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thethirdindustrialrevolution.com/|title=Jeremy Rifkin and The Third Industrial Revolution Home Page|publisher=The third industrial revolution.com|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref> claimed that 3D printing signals the beginning of a [[third industrial revolution]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21552901|title=A third industrial revolution|date=21 April 2012|work=The Economist|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref> succeeding the [[production line]] assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century.\n\n=== Social change ===\n[[File:3D Printing-skylt.jpg|thumb|Street sign in [[Windhoek]], [[Namibia]], advertising 3D printing, July 2018]]\nSince the 1950s, a number of writers and social commentators have speculated in some depth about the social and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-104\" /> In recent years, 3D printing is creating significant impact in the humanitarian and development sector. Its potential to facilitate distributed manufacturing is resulting in supply chain and logistics benefits, by reducing the need for transportation, warehousing and wastage. Furthermore, social and economic development is being advanced through the creation of local production economies.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nOthers have suggested that as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-105\" /> Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-106\" /> Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.\n\nAs 3D printers became more accessible to consumers, online social platforms have developed to support the community.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-107\" /> This includes websites that allow users to access information such as how to build a 3D printer, as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss 3D printing news, as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-108\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-109\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-110\" /> RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing, and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone. Furthermore, there are other sites such as [[Pinshape]], [[Thingiverse]] and [[MyMiniFactory]], which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print, allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files. These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users, creating communities dedicated to 3D printing.\n\nSome call attention to the conjunction of [[Commons-based peer production]] with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques.<ref name=\"triple-c.at\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-111\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-112\" /> The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity.<ref name=\"triple-c.at\" /> Further, it is true that many issues, problems, and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones.<ref name=\"triple-c.at\" /> For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting<ref name=\"AutoSQ-113\" /> and on intellectual property.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-114\" /> It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, [[Commons-based peer production]] 3D printing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools.<ref name=\"triple-c.at\" /> And following Neil Gershenfeld<ref name=\"AutoSQ-115\" /> in that \"some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies,\" Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs.\n\n[[Larry Summers]] wrote about the \"devastating consequences\" of 3D printing and other technologies (robots, artificial intelligence, etc.) for those who perform routine tasks. In his view, \"already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead.\" Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the \"myriad devices\" (e.g., tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage) enabling the holders of great wealth to \"a paying\" income and estate taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring \"great social contributions\" in return, including: more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property, greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation, strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements, improvements in corporate governance, strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity, easing of land-use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value, better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers, and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development\u2014e.g., in energy production and transportation.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-116\" />\n\n[[Michael Spence]] wrote that \"Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors\u2014think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.\" In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. 3D printers) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. \"Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling.\"<ref name=\"AutoSQ-117\" />\n\nSpence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor.\" For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that \"the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution.\"<ref name=\"AutoSQ-117\" />\n\n[[Naomi Wu]] regards the usage of 3D printing in the Chinese classroom (where rote memorization is standard) to teach design principles and creativity as the most exciting recent development of the technology, and more generally regards 3D printing as being the next [[desktop publishing]] revolution.<ref name=\"3D Printing in the Chinese Classroom\">{{Cite web |url=https://womenin3dprinting.com/2017/11/29/naomi-wu-my-visibility-allows-me-to-direct-more-attention-to-important-issues-and-other-deserving-women/ |title=Naomi Wu \u2013 \"My visibility allows me to direct more attention to important issues and other deserving women\" |last=Andre |first=Helene |date=29 November 2017 |website=Women in 3D Printing |access-date=3 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204171133/https://womenin3dprinting.com/2017/11/29/naomi-wu-my-visibility-allows-me-to-direct-more-attention-to-important-issues-and-other-deserving-women/ |archive-date=4 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental change ===\n\nThe growth of additive manufacturing could have a large impact on the environment. As opposed to traditional manufacturing, for instance, in which pieces are cut from larger blocks of material, additive manufacturing creates products layer-by-layer and prints only relevant parts, wasting much less material and thus wasting less energy in producing the raw materials needed.<ref name=\"Is 3D Printing the Future of Sustainable Manufacturing?\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.environmentalleader.com/2015/11/is-3d-printing-the-future-of-sustainable-manufacturing/ |title=Is 3D Printing the Future of Sustainable Manufacturing? |last=Hardcastle |first=Jessica Lyons |date=24 November 2015 |website=Environmental Leader |access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> By making only the bare structural necessities of products, additive manufacturing also could make a profound contribution to [[lightweighting]], reducing the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of vehicles and other forms of transportation.<ref name=\"Lightweighting with Lattices\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.additivemanufacturing.media/blog/post/lightweighting-with-lattices(2) |title=Lightweighting with Lattices |last=Simpson |first=Timothy W. |date=31 January 2018 |website=Additive Manufacturing |access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> A case study on an airplane component made using additive manufacturing, for example, found that the component's use saves 63% of relevant energy and carbon dioxide emissions over the course of the product's lifetime.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.econolyst.co.uk/resources/documents/files/Presentation___2012___AM_and_carbon_footprint.pdf |title=Example of Econolyst Research-Understanding the Benefits of AM on CO2 |last=Reeves |first=P. |date=2012 |website=The Econolyst |access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> In addition, previous [[life-cycle assessment]] of additive manufacturing has estimated that adopting the technology could further lower carbon dioxide emissions since 3D printing creates localized production, and products would not need to be transported long distances to reach their final destination.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gelber |first1=Malte |last2=Uiterkamp |first2=Anton J.M.

Despite additive manufacturing reducing waste from the subtractive manufacturing process by up to 90%, the additive manufacturing process creates other forms of waste such as non-recyclable material powders.

In the 1990s, 3D-printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes and a more appropriate term for it was [[rapid prototyping]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmg-muenchen.de/training-course/11/Additive-Manufacturing?flang=en|title=Learning Course: Additive Manufacturing \u2013 Additive Fertigung|website=tmg-muenchen.de}}</ref> {{As of|2019}}, the precision, repeatability, and material range have increased to the point that some 3D-printing processes are considered viable as an industrial-production technology, whereby the term '''additive manufacturing''' can be used synonymously with \"3D printing\". One of the key advantages of 3D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries, and a prerequisite for producing any 3D printed part is a digital [[3D modeling|3D model]] or a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] file.\n\nThe most-commonly used 3D-printing process (46% {{as of|2018|lc=on}}) is a material extrusion technique called [[Fused filament fabrication#Fused deposition modeling|fused deposition modeling]] (FDM).<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.statista.com/statistics/560304/worldwide-survey-3d-printing-top-technologies/|title= Most used 3D printing technologies 2017\u20132018 {{!}} Statistic|website= Statista|language= en|access-date= 2 December 2018}}</ref> While FDM technology was invented after the other two most popular technologies, stereolithography (SLA) and selective laser sintering (SLS), FDM is typically the most inexpensive of the three by a large margin, which lends to the popularity of the process.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe [[umbrella term]] ''additive manufacturing (AM)'' gained popularity in the 2000s,<ref name=\"Ngram_additive_manufacturing\" /> inspired by the theme of material being added together ([[3D printing processes|in any of various ways]]). In contrast, the term ''subtractive manufacturing'' appeared as a [[retronym]] for the large family of [[machining]] processes with material ''removal'' as their common theme. The term ''3D printing'' still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds, and the term ''AM'' was more likely to be used in metalworking and end use part production contexts than among polymer, ink-jet, or stereo lithography enthusiasts.\n\nBy early 2010s, the terms ''3D printing'' and ''additive manufacturing'' evolved [[word sense|senses]] in which they were alternate umbrella terms for additive technologies, one being used in popular language by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial end-use part producers, machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term ''3D printing'' has been associated with machines low in price or in capability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/69669.html|title=ISO/ASTM 52900:2015 \u2013 Additive manufacturing \u2013 General principles \u2013 Terminology|website=iso.org|language=en|access-date=15 June 2017}}</ref> ''3D printing'' and ''additive manufacturing'' reflect that the technologies share the theme of material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of ''Additive Manufacturing'' magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often [[synonym]]ous in casual usage<ref name=\"Zelinski_2017-08-04\">{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=4 August 2017 |title=Additive manufacturing and 3D printing are two different things |journal=Additive Manufacturing |url=http://www.additivemanufacturing.media/columns/additive-manufacturing-and-3d-printing-are-two-different-things |accessdate=11 August 2017 |postscript=.}}</ref> but some manufacturing industry experts are trying to make a distinction whereby Additive Manufacturing [[hyponymy and hypernymy|comprises]] 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a [[manufacturing process]].<ref name=\"Zelinski_2017-08-04\" />\n\nOther terms that have been used as synonyms or [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hypernyms]] have included ''desktop manufacturing'', ''rapid manufacturing'' (as the logical production-level successor to ''[[rapid prototyping]]''), and ''on-demand manufacturing'' (which echoes ''[[print on demand|on-demand printing]]'' in the 2D sense of ''printing''). Such application of the adjectives ''rapid'' and ''on-demand'' to the noun ''manufacturing'' was novel in the 2000s reveals the prevailing [[mental model]] of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long [[lead time]]s for laborious tooling development. Today, the term ''subtractive'' has not replaced the term ''machining'', instead [[wikt:complement#Verb|complementing]] it when a term that covers any removal method is needed. [[Agile tooling]] is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick [[Prototype|prototyping]] and responses to tooling and fixture needs. Agile tooling uses a cost-effective and high-quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs, and it can be used in [[Hydroforming|hydro-forming]], [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], [[Injection molding machine|injection molding]] and other manufacturing processes.\n\n== History ==\n=== 1970s ===\nIn 1974, [[David E.

However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold, which is then used to make metal parts.<ref name=\"Auto3D-9\" />\n\nISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes within its meaning: binder jetting, directed energy deposition, material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion, sheet lamination, and vat photopolymerization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/ISOASTM52900.htm|title=Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing \u2013 General Principles \u2013 Terminology|date=1 December 2015|website=ASTM International \u2013 Standards Worldwide|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers. In [[Fused filament fabrication]], also known as [[Fused deposition modeling]] (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of [[thermoplastic]], metal wire, or other material is fed into an [[extrusion]] nozzle head ([[3D printer extruder]]), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Selective Heat Sintering Works |url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/powder-bed-fusion/selective-heat-sintering-shs |publisher=THRE3D.com |accessdate=3 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203071153/https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/powder-bed-fusion/selective-heat-sintering-shs |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref> Recently, FFF/FDM has expanded to 3-D print directly from pellets to avoid the conversion to filament.

These techniques include [[selective laser sintering]], with both metals and polymers, and [[direct metal laser sintering]].<ref name=\"DMLS\" /> [[Selective laser melting]] does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals. [[Electron beam melting]] is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. [[titanium alloy]]s). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum.<ref name=\"Auto3D-12\" /><ref name=\"Auto3D-13\" /> Another method consists of an [[Powder bed and inkjet head 3D printing|inkjet 3D printing]] system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder ([[plaster]], or [[resin]]s) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With [[laminated object manufacturing]], thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. In addition to the previously mentioned methods, [[HP Inc.|HP]] has developed the Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) which is a powder base technique, though no laser are involved. An inkjet array applies fusing and detailing agents which are then combined by heating to create a solid layer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://make.3dexperience.3ds.com/processes/material-extrusion|title=Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) by HP|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[File:Schematic representation of Stereolithography.png|thumb|upright|Schematic representation of Stereolithography; a light-emitting device ''a)'' (laser or DLP) selectively illuminate the transparent bottom ''c)'' of a tank ''b)'' filled with a liquid photo-polymerizing resin; the solidified resin ''d)'' is progressively dragged up by a lifting platform ''e)'']] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as [[stereolithography]].

Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in [[two-photon absorption|multiphoton]] photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away.

These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between human and robot is inevitable. The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices, post processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until maturity of the fabrication is achieved. Instead of the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Thus, 3D printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionise the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical, functional, and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external [[joint]]s, [[adhesive]]s, and [[fastener]]s.\nCircuit board manufacturing involves multiple steps which include imaging, drilling, plating, soldermask coating, nomenclature printing and surface finishes. These steps include many chemicals such as harsh solvents and acids. 3D printing circuit boards remove the need for many of these steps while still producing complex designs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shortsleeveandtieclub.com/3d-printed-circuit-boards-are-the-next-big-thing-in-additive-manufacturing/|title=3D Printed Circuit Boards are the Next Big Thing in Additive Manufacturing|date=20 June 2018}}</ref> Polymer ink is used to create the layers of the build while silver polymer is used for creating the traces and holes used to allow electricity to flow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nano-di.com/materials|title=Additive Manufacturing Inks & Materials for Custom 3D Printing Solutions|first=Nano|last=Dimension|website=nano-di.com}}</ref> Current circuit board manufacturing can be a tedious process depending on the design. Specified materials are gathered and sent into inner layer processing where images are printed, developed and etched. The etches cores are typically punched to add lamination tooling. The cores are then prepared for lamination. The stack-up, the buildup of a circuit board, is built and sent into lamination where the layers are bonded. The boards are then measured and drilled. Many steps may differ from this stage however for simple designs, the material goes through a plating process to plate the holes and surface. The outer image is then printed, developed and etched. After the image is defined, the material must get coated with soldermask for later soldering. Nomenclature is then added so components can be identified later. Then the surface finish is added. The boards are routed out of panel form into their singular or array form and then electrically tested. Aside from the paperwork which must be completed which proves the boards meet specifications, the boards are then packed and shipped. The benefits of 3D printing would be that the final outline is defined from the beginning, no imaging, punching or lamination is required and electrical connections are made with the silver polymer which eliminates drilling and plating. The final paperwork would also be greatly reduced due to the lack of materials required to build the circuit board. Complex designs which may takes weeks to complete through normal processing can be 3D printed, greatly reducing manufacturing time.\n\n== Legal aspects ==\n\n=== Intellectual property ===\n{{See also|Free hardware}}\n3D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes, including [[patent]]s, [[industrial design right]]s, [[copyright]]s, and [[trademark]]s may apply. However, there is not much [[jurisprudence]] to say how these laws will apply if 3D printers become mainstream and individuals or hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use, for non-profit distribution, or for sale.\n\nAny of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in 3D printing, or the distribution or sale of the printed item. To be allowed to do these things, where an active intellectual property was involved, a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence, which may come with conditions and a price. However, many patent, design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for 'private', 'non-commercial' use of inventions, designs or works of art protected under intellectual property (IP). That standard limitation or exception may leave such private, non-commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights.\n\nPatents cover inventions including processes, machines, manufacturing, and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries, but generally 20 years from the date of application. Therefore, if a type of wheel is patented, printing, using, or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-82\" />\n\nCopyright covers an expression<ref name=\"wired\" /> in a tangible, fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus 70&nbsp;years thereafter.<ref name=\"deal\" /> If someone makes a statue, they may have a copyright mark on the appearance of that statue, so if someone sees that statue, they cannot then distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue.\n\nWhen a feature has both artistic (copyrightable) and functional (patentable) merits, when the question has appeared in US court, the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item.<ref name=\"deal\" /> In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of unauthorized copying, only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent.\n\n=== Gun legislation and administration ===\n{{Main|3D printed firearms}}\nThe US [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[Joint Regional Intelligence Center]] released a memo stating that \"significant advances in three-dimensional (3D) printing capabilities, availability of free digital 3D printable files for firearms components, and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture 3D printed guns\" and that \"proposed legislation to ban 3D printing of weapons may deter, but cannot completely prevent, their production. Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation, online distribution of these 3D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music, movie or software files.\"<ref name=\"AutoSQ-83\" /> Currently, it is not prohibited by law to manufacture firearms for personal use in the United States, as long as the firearm is not produced with the intent to be sold or transferred, and meets a few basic requirements. A license is required to manufacture firearms for sale or distribution. The law prohibits a person from assembling a non\u2013sporting semiautomatic rifle or shotgun from 10 or more imported parts, as well as firearms that cannot be detected by metal detectors or x\u2013ray machines. In addition, the making of an NFA firearm requires a tax payment and advance approval by ATF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/does-individual-need-license-make-firearm-personal-use|title=Does an individual need a license to make a firearm for personal use? {{!}} Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|website=www.atf.gov|access-date=22 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAttempting to restrict the distribution of gun plans via the Internet has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of [[DeCSS]], which enabled DVD [[ripping]].<ref name=\"AutoSQ-90\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-91\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-92\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-93\" /> After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans, they were still widely available via the [[The Pirate Bay|Pirate Bay]] and other file sharing sites.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-94\" /> Downloads of the plans from the UK, Germany, Spain, and Brazil were heavy.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-88\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-89\" /> Some US legislators have proposed regulations on 3D printers to prevent them from being used for printing guns.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-95\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-96\" /> 3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile, could cripple the 3D printing industry, and could infringe on free speech rights, with early pioneer of 3D printing Professor [[Hod Lipson]] suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-97\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-98\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-99\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-101\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-102\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-103\" />\n\nInternationally, where gun controls are generally stricter than in the United States, some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt since alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-84\" /> Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a 3D printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-85\" /> [[Europol]] stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons but noted that as technology improves, the risks of an effect would increase.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-86\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-87\" />\n\n=== Aerospace regulation ===\nIn the United States, the FAA has anticipated a desire to use additive manufacturing techniques and has been considering how best to regulate this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/faa-prepares-guidance-for-wave-of-3d-printed-aerospace-parts/|title=FAA prepares guidance for wave of 3D-printed aerospace parts|date=20 October 2017|website=SpaceNews.com}}</ref> The FAA has jurisdiction over such fabrication because all aircraft parts must be made under FAA production approval or under other FAA regulatory categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5;node=14:1.0.1.3.9#se14.1.21_19|title=eCFR \u2013 Code of Federal Regulations|website=ecfr.gov}}</ref> In December 2016, the FAA approved the production of a 3D printed fuel nozzle for the GE LEAP engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/faa-launch-eight-year-additive-manufacturing-road-map-123108/|title=FAA to launch eight-year additive manufacturing road map|date=21 October 2017|website=3D Printing Industry}}</ref> Aviation attorney Jason Dickstein has suggested that additive manufacturing is merely a production method, and should be regulated like any other production method.<ref name=\"arsa.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://arsa.org/news-media/newsletters/2017-edition-4/|title=2017 \u2013 Edition 4 \u2013 May 5, 2017 \u2013 ARSA|website=arsa.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mro-network.com/safety-regulatory/embracing-drones-and-3d-printing-regulatory-framework|title=Embracing Drones and 3D Printing in the Regulatory Framework|date=10 January 2018|website=MRO Network}}</ref> He has suggested that the FAA's focus should be on guidance to explain compliance, rather than on changing the existing rules, and that existing regulations and guidance permit a company \"to develop a robust quality system that adequately reflects regulatory needs for quality assurance.\"<ref name=\"arsa.org\" />\n\n== Health and safety ==\n{{Split section |Health and safety hazards of 3D printing |discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split proposed |date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:NIOSH Scientists Investigating Pollution From Office Equipment.webm|thumb|A video on research done on printer emissions]]\n\n{{See also|Health and safety hazards of nanomaterials}}\n\nResearch on the health and safety concerns of 3D printing is new and in development due to the recent proliferation of 3D printing devices.

These post-processing activities can include chemical baths, sanding, polishing, or vapor exposure to refine surface finish, as well as general [[Machining|subtractive manufacturing]] techniques such as drilling, milling, or turning to modify the printed geometry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fictiv.com/hwg/fabricate/ultimate-guide-to-finishing-3d-printed-parts|title=Ultimate Guide to Finishing 3D Printed Parts {{!}} Fictiv \u2013 Hardware Guide|website=fictiv.com|language=en|access-date=19 October 2017}}</ref> Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used, such as respirators or safety glasses.

These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSince 3-D imaging creates items by fusing materials together, there runs the risk of layer separation in some devices made using 3-D Imaging.

Its potential to facilitate distributed manufacturing is resulting in supply chain and logistics benefits, by reducing the need for transportation, warehousing and wastage. Furthermore, social and economic development is being advanced through the creation of local production economies.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nOthers have suggested that as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-105\" /> Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-106\" /> Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.\n\nAs 3D printers became more accessible to consumers, online social platforms have developed to support the community.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-107\" /> This includes websites that allow users to access information such as how to build a 3D printer, as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss 3D printing news, as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-108\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-109\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-110\" /> RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing, and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone. Furthermore, there are other sites such as [[Pinshape]], [[Thingiverse]] and [[MyMiniFactory]], which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print, allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files. These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users, creating communities dedicated to 3D printing.\n\nSome call attention to the conjunction of [[Commons-based peer production]] with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques.<ref name=\"triple-c.at\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-111\" /><ref name=\"AutoSQ-112\" /> The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity.<ref name=\"triple-c.at\" /> Further, it is true that many issues, problems, and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones.<ref name=\"triple-c.at\" /> For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting<ref name=\"AutoSQ-113\" /> and on intellectual property.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-114\" /> It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, [[Commons-based peer production]] 3D printing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools.<ref name=\"triple-c.at\" /> And following Neil Gershenfeld<ref name=\"AutoSQ-115\" /> in that \"some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies,\" Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs.\n\n[[Larry Summers]] wrote about the \"devastating consequences\" of 3D printing and other technologies (robots, artificial intelligence, etc.) for those who perform routine tasks. In his view, \"already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead.\" Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the \"myriad devices\" (e.g., tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage) enabling the holders of great wealth to \"a paying\" income and estate taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring \"great social contributions\" in return, including: more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property, greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation, strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements, improvements in corporate governance, strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity, easing of land-use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value, better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers, and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development\u2014e.g., in energy production and transportation.<ref name=\"AutoSQ-116\" />\n\n[[Michael Spence]] wrote that \"Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors\u2014think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.\" In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. 3D printers) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. \"Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling.\"<ref name=\"AutoSQ-117\" />\n\nSpence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor.\" For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that \"the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution.\"<ref name=\"AutoSQ-117\" />\n\n[[Naomi Wu]] regards the usage of 3D printing in the Chinese classroom (where rote memorization is standard) to teach design principles and creativity as the most exciting recent development of the technology, and more generally regards 3D printing as being the next [[desktop publishing]] revolution.<ref name=\"3D Printing in the Chinese Classroom\">{{Cite web |url=https://womenin3dprinting.com/2017/11/29/naomi-wu-my-visibility-allows-me-to-direct-more-attention-to-important-issues-and-other-deserving-women/ |title=Naomi Wu \u2013 \"My visibility allows me to direct more attention to important issues and other deserving women\" |last=Andre |first=Helene |date=29 November 2017 |website=Women in 3D Printing |access-date=3 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204171133/https://womenin3dprinting.com/2017/11/29/naomi-wu-my-visibility-allows-me-to-direct-more-attention-to-important-issues-and-other-deserving-women/ |archive-date=4 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental change ===\n\nThe growth of additive manufacturing could have a large impact on the environment. As opposed to traditional manufacturing, for instance, in which pieces are cut from larger blocks of material, additive manufacturing creates products layer-by-layer and prints only relevant parts, wasting much less material and thus wasting less energy in producing the raw materials needed.<ref name=\"Is 3D Printing the Future of Sustainable Manufacturing?\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.environmentalleader.com/2015/11/is-3d-printing-the-future-of-sustainable-manufacturing/ |title=Is 3D Printing the Future of Sustainable Manufacturing? |last=Hardcastle |first=Jessica Lyons |date=24 November 2015 |website=Environmental Leader |access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> By making only the bare structural necessities of products, additive manufacturing also could make a profound contribution to [[lightweighting]], reducing the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of vehicles and other forms of transportation.<ref name=\"Lightweighting with Lattices\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.additivemanufacturing.media/blog/post/lightweighting-with-lattices(2) |title=Lightweighting with Lattices |last=Simpson |first=Timothy W. |date=31 January 2018 |website=Additive Manufacturing |access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> A case study on an airplane component made using additive manufacturing, for example, found that the component's use saves 63% of relevant energy and carbon dioxide emissions over the course of the product's lifetime.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.econolyst.co.uk/resources/documents/files/Presentation___2012___AM_and_carbon_footprint.pdf |title=Example of Econolyst Research-Understanding the Benefits of AM on CO2 |last=Reeves |first=P. |date=2012 |website=The Econolyst |access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> In addition, previous [[life-cycle assessment]] of additive manufacturing has estimated that adopting the technology could further lower carbon dioxide emissions since 3D printing creates localized production, and products would not need to be transported long distances to reach their final destination.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gelber |first1=Malte |last2=Uiterkamp |first2=Anton J.M.

Despite additive manufacturing reducing waste from the subtractive manufacturing process by up to 90%, the additive manufacturing process creates other forms of waste such as non-recyclable material powders.

The original students came primarily from the Carson Road and Pineview neighbourhoods. During the 1980s and early 90s, students from Fallingbrook in Orleans were bussed to the school. Eventually, the entire school was home to students bussed from Orleans while a new campus was built at its current location on Tenth Line Road. After moving to the new location, students from Pineview/Carson Road attended Gloucester High School and the building was eventually purchased by the French Catholic school board as the new home for Coll\u00e8ge Catholique Samuel-Genest.\n\n== School layout ==\nSir Wilfrid Laurier is a two-story school. It includes a full resource library, and number of computer labs which hosts classes and individual work. The gym can be split into three divisions, creating space to host multiple activities or host larger sports games. Close to the gymnasium is a fitness room which includes treadmills, bench press equipment, and a variety of exercise machines. There is also a track at the back of the school and an outdoor basketball court. With the connection to the Ray Friel Recreational Complex, gym classes are able to access the swimming pool, skating rink, and public library. The school also has a broadcasting lab which is used for its broadcasting program.\n\n== Extra-curricular activities ==\nThe school participates in a wide range of sports for both males and females.

The original students came primarily from the Carson Road and Pineview neighbourhoods. During the 1980s and early 90s, students from Fallingbrook in Orleans were bussed to the school. Eventually, the entire school was home to students bussed from Orleans while a new campus was built at its current location on Tenth Line Road. After moving to the new location, students from Pineview/Carson Road attended Gloucester High School and the building was eventually purchased by the French Catholic school board as the new home for Coll\u00e8ge Catholique Samuel-Genest.\n\n== School layout ==\nSir Wilfrid Laurier is a two-story school. It includes a full resource library, and number of computer labs which hosts classes and individual work. The gym can be split into three divisions, creating space to host multiple activities or host larger sports games. Close to the gymnasium is a fitness room which includes treadmills, bench press equipment, and a variety of exercise machines. There is also a track at the back of the school and an outdoor basketball court. With the connection to the Ray Friel Recreational Complex, gym classes are able to access the swimming pool, skating rink, and public library. The school also has a broadcasting lab which is used for its broadcasting program.\n\n== Extra-curricular activities ==\nThe school participates in a wide range of sports for both males and females. The fall sports include: golf, football, cross-country running, basketball (girls), soccer, volleyball (boys), tennis, ultimate frisbee, and rugby (7's). Winter sports include: badminton, basketball (boys), hockey, cross-country skiing, curling, ski/snowboarding, volleyball (girls), and swimming.

It comprised the reigns of three emperors and is known for repelling the [[Song dynasty|Song]] invasion of its nation.\n\n==Founding==\nAfter the assassination of the emperor, [[\u0110inh Ti\u00ean Ho\u00e0ng]], and the emperor's first son, [[\u0110inh Li\u1ec5n]], the third son of the emperor, [[\u0110inh Ph\u1ebf \u0110\u1ebf]], assumed the throne at aged six with the regent [[L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n]]. During the regency of L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n, members of the royal court skeptical of L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n's loyalty to the true emperor, such as the Duke of \u0110\u1ecbnh [[Nguy\u1ec5n B\u1eb7c]] and General \u0110inh \u0110i\u1ec1n, led an army to the imperial palace in an attempted coup. The failure of the undertaking caused those two figures to be executed. \nIn 980, the [[Song dynasty]] of [[China]] under [[Emperor Taizong of Song|Emperor Taizong]] ordered a Chinese army to invade \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. Because the young emperor was unable to lead the country to against the invader, the mandarins of the royal court discussed with Empress [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u00e2n Nga]] about enthroning the most trusted general and regent, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n. Most of them voted in the affirmative to this proposal; consequently, the empress dethroned her own son and gave the crown to L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n. He accepted the emperorship, establishing a new dynasty named the Early L\u00ea dynasty. L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n is often referred to with the [[posthumous name]] L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh.\n\n==L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh (980\u20131005)==\n{{further|Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (981)}}\nFollowing war threats from [[Song dynasty|Song China]], L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh made preparations for war while the Song forces advanced toward \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. Later at the [[Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (981)|Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River]], L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh's forces, under the command of General [[Ph\u1ea1m C\u1ef1 L\u01b0\u1ee3ng]], were successful at halting the overland advance of the Song forces, although they incurred some losses. Seeking peace, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh sent emissaries to negotiate for peace; thus the annual show of homage and offerings to the Celestial Emperor of China were resumed as a means to appease the Song dynasty.\n\nIn 982, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh began expeditions to [[Champa]], a nation south of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. \nL\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh's army met the combined forces of Champa, [[Chenla]] and [[Abbasid]] Mercenaries in \u0110\u1ed3 B\u00e0n, ([[Qu\u1ea3ng Nam]] province today) and be able to defeated all of them. Champa king [[Paramesvaravarman I]] had been beheaded and Champa capital of [[Indrapura (Champa)|Indrapura]] was sacked by the Vietnamese. The new king of Champa agreed to be a [[Vassal state|vassal state]] of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t in 983.<ref>[[Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean]]: \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0 1.

Page. 222</ref>\n\nSome domestic achievements of L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh include constructing new monuments and galvanizing agricultural and handicraft production in order to make economic progress. Many spiritual etiquettes were developed, and L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh's government was the model for that of the succeeding dynasty.\nL\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh died in 1005 at the age of 65 and after 25 years of rule. In his will, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh gave the throne to his youngest son, L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t.\n\n==The succession crisis==\n===L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t (1005)===\nOut of his many princes, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n appointed his first prince [[L\u00ea Long Th\u00e2u]] as the crown prince in the early years of his rule. Th\u00e2u died in 1000, and L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n was forced to choose another crown prince.\nThe fifth prince Duke of Khai Minh, [[L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh]], nominated himself as crown prince. According to the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]], L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n viewed him as the favourable to become the next emperor, but royal court mandarins suggested him not to do it because they viewed other candidates as more viable. L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n followed the advice and chose his older brother L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7, the duke of Nam Phong.\nIn 1005, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n died after reigning for 24 years at Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Xu\u00e2n Palace.\nAfter the death, there was a succession dispute between the princes L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh, L\u00ea Long T\u00edch, and L\u00ea Long K\u00ednh and crown prince L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t, preventing a government to take control over the entire country for eight months. In the winter of 1005, L\u00ea Long T\u00edch was defeated by crown prince L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t. He fled to Th\u1ea1ch H\u00e0 province, now [[H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province]], and ordered the massacre of the locals there. After a few months, L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t was able to proclaim himself emperor [[L\u00ea Trung T\u00f4ng (Early L\u00ea)|L\u00ea Trung T\u00f4ng]] but was assassinated after ruling for three days by L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh, who replaced him as emperor.\n\n===L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh (1005\u20131009)===\nL\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh mustered large military forces, defeating the other princes.\nAfter stabilizing his rule through war, he enhanced foreign relations with the [[Song dynasty]] with a gentle and friendly policy. The emperor gave full support for Buddhism and sought Chinese Buddhist canon and scripture for practice in Vietnam.\nHe also supervised the national economy and began the construction of bridges, roads, and other infrastructure for easy transportation of people and commodities, especially water. In 1009, he established the exchange of goods and products in [[Nanning]] with the [[Song dynasty]], albeit it was limited as the Song emperor only allowed Vietnamese businessmen to trade at specific locations near the border like [[Hepu County]], [[Guangxi]].\n\n====Hemorrhoids====\nThe emperor was famous for suffering from hemorrhoids, which made him unable to sit on the throne and instead forced him to lie on his throne. His famous lying sessions earned him the name [[L\u00ea Ng\u1ecda Tri\u1ec1u]] throughout his reign, meaning \"the one who rules while lying on the throne.\"<ref>[http://www.philosophy.ru/iphras/library/viet.html \u0410\u041d\u0422\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0413\u0418\u042f \u0422\u0420\u0410\u0414\u0418\u0426\u0418\u041e\u041d\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0412\u042c\u0415\u0422\u041d\u0410\u041c\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418.

Although Buddhism played a key role in his life and politics, the emperor often used Buddhist monks for so-called entertainment such as by exfoliating sugar canes atop a monk's head until it began to bleed. Employing many corrupt or otherwise incompetent officials into important court positions only further encouraged these tendencies of the emperor.\nAs a result of the emperor's poor health, according to some sources, most power was actually controlled by one of the members of the L\u00fd family [[L\u00fd C\u00f4ng U\u1ea9n]]. High resentment from the public and the imperial court culminated for a long period preceding L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh's death. After L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh died the court agreed to enthrone the high-rank mandarin and aristocrat L\u00fd C\u00f4ng U\u1ea9n as the new emperor under pressure from the public and from the Buddhist monks, thus ending the Early L\u00ea Dynasty. In its place, the [[L\u00fd dynasty]] ushered in a new age for Vietnam, with a combination of Confucian and Buddhist influences recurring in the new dynasty.\n\n==Domestic==\n===Administrative centre===\nThe Early L\u00ea Dynasty dynasty modified the traditional government form of the [[\u0110inh dynasty]], although it modified some parts of it. In 980, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n appointed several men to court positions: [[H\u1ed3ng Hi\u1ebfn]] as the grand chancellor, known in Vietnamese as Th\u00e1i s\u01b0; [[Ph\u1ea1m C\u1ef1 L\u1ea1ng]] as the vice-chancellor, or Th\u00e1i \u00fay; [[T\u1eeb M\u1ee5c]] as grand governor of court, \u0110\u1ea1i t\u1ed5ng qu\u1ea3n; and [[\u0110inh Th\u1eeba Chinh]] as royal capital interior military commander, in Vietnamese Nha n\u1ed9i \u0111\u00f4 ch\u1ec9 huy s\u1ee9.\nA major reform, however, was the distribution of specific duties and powers to each mandarin in contrast to the \u0110inh dynasty's centralizing all power to the emperor.\n<ref name=\"dvsktb205\"/>\n[[File:Dinhyenthanh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Temple of \u0110\u00ecnh Y\u00ean Th\u00e0nh, [[Hoa L\u01b0]], [[Ninh B\u00ecnh]].]]\n\n===Rebellion oppression===\nIn the ruling era, L\u00ea emperors often faced the revolts of some local Tribal chief and viceroy, especially in remote areas, retaining the specific authorization to quell them.\nIn 980, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh ordered D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ti\u1ebfn L\u1ed9c to collect taxes from Hoan and \u00c1i province, now [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]] and [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province]]. However, D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ti\u1ebfn L\u1ed9c opposed it and seized the two provinces, proposing to place them under the control of the Kingdom of [[Champa]], which refused him in order to maintain a friendly relationship with \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh led an army to defeat and kill L\u1ed9c along with a general massacre of citizens in those two provinces.\nThis, however, is only an example of rebellion: there were more than ten rebellions against the royal court during a reign of five years.\n\n===Transportation===\nAfter victory over Champa in 983, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh merged the seized territory into the country and started to build more roads from the south estuary to [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]] at the south of his realm. Then he ordered the dredging of the \u0110a C\u00e1i canal in 1003. \nIn 1009, the country started the massive construction of transportation infrastructure for trading among the regions and to facilitate travel for soldiers heading south.\n\n===Economy===\n====Taxation====\nThe Early L\u00ea dynasty imposed taxation based on land property. Taxes included a public benefit tax, which was ten days' worth of labor for public projects; a household tax on property paid annually; and a military tax added to the household tax specifically for military operations, including public security at home. The taxation on property was borrowed from the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties of China, only collecting goods and not money. Simultaneously, the government implementing trade-promoting policies by not taxing the property of traders except for land owned.<ref name=\"bnlsvn80\" />\n\n====Agriculture====\nAgriculture was the fundamental element of the economy of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t during the Early L\u00ea dynasty. Most of the land of villages was under the control of the royal court and owned by it by law.\nLand was given one of four types. The emperor's land was cultivated with a spiritual significance, intended to have the people to take part in agricultural activities, mainly prisoners and peasants, with all products going to the royal court; it was first implemented by L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh in 987. Meanwhile, distributive land was distributed to mandarins for the benefiting and contributing to the country or to princes as an accommodation. It was not private property and was returned to the royal court when the landowner died. Religious land was set aside for the practices of Buddhist monks; private land was owned and sold freely between individuals without government interference. Besides that, the government encouraged subjects to exploit wild and untouched land by settling it, providing property at a lower cost while simultaneously expanding its influence in unsettled regions. Peasants shared the land equally and cultivate it, regularly paying taxes to the government for the government's budget.<ref name=\"dvsktt1\" />\n\n[[File:Dinhhoaxa-Minhngulau.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Temple of Hoa X\u00e1 \u2013 Minh Ng\u1ef1 L\u00e2u]]\n\n====Trade====\nThe emperors were focused on an open new trade route through roads and waterways. Records report that such infrastructure projects were undertaken mainly in the years 983, 1003, and 1009.\nThe main trade partner of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t was China, and both sides agreed to establish bilateral exchanging of goods at borders.\nSome local high officials supported commercial activity among local parties. A delegation of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t acted as a government arbitrator in trade disputes. Some typical exports of Vietnam were gold, silver, and bronze products.<ref name=\"thq112\">Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng H\u1eefu Qu\u00fdnh, \u0110inh Xu\u00e2n L\u00e2m, L\u00ea M\u1eadu H\u00e3n, s\u00e1ch \u0111\u00e3 d\u1eabn, tr 112</ref>\n\n====Culture====\nThere are not much sources describing the culture under Early L\u00ea dynasty. However, it is known that Buddhism was the most widespread religion, affecting the flourishing of Buddhism in China's [[Tang dynasty]]. Monks were given an elevated status in government affairs, being allowed to participate in politics and national planning.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n===Song dynasty===\n\u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t pretended to be a vassal state of the Song during the Early L\u00ea dynasty, although in reality it was an independent state, thereby simultaneously maintaining both peace with China and independence. L\u00ea emperors, however, were sometimes threatened by the nomadic [[Khitan people]] in the north of [[China]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cla.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/handbook/triet_hoc_chinh_tri.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110042938/http://www.cla.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/handbook/triet_hoc_chinh_tri.html |archive-date=2017-11-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter a [[Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (981)|failed invasion]] in 981, the Song emperor accepted L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n as the ruler of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t but just regarded him as the Jiedushi, or regional military governor, of the Annam protectorate, as the Chinese called the \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t.\nIn 986 and 987 and 990, Emperor Taizong of the Song continued to dispatch diplomatic envoys to \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. \nIn 995, the Song emperor Taizong granted L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n the title Duke of Giao Ch\u1ec9 (Chinese: Jiaozhi). \nIn 995 and 996, there was a rebellion of local officials and other discontents of both sides at the border. Song soldiers captured more than 100 people and returned them back to \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t, while \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t did the same by returning 27 people to the Song. Both sides expressed gratitude to the other. \nThus the relation of both nations could be seen as friendly.\n\n===Champa===\nThe relation of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t in the north and Champa in the south was regarded as hostile. In 981, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh sent an envoy to Champa, who was captured by them. The diplomatic incident sparked a war between the two countries.\nIn 982, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n victoriously took part in the campaign against Champa, killing the Cham king at the battlefield. Then he sacked the capital of Cham and captured a hundred soldiers and concubines along with one Indian monk, taking home precious goods such as gold and silver. Moreover, he burned the fortresses and tombs of former Champa kings. \nIn 992, the Champa king Harivarman II sent an envoy to \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t to ask for the release of 360 prisoners back to the homeland.\n\n==References==\n* {{in lang|ru}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20111019134021/http://philosophy.ru/iphras/library/viet.html \u0410\u041d\u0422\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0413\u0418\u042f \u0422\u0420\u0410\u0414\u0418\u0426\u0418\u041e\u041d\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0412\u042c\u0415\u0422\u041d\u0410\u041c\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418.

It comprised the reigns of three emperors and is known for repelling the [[Song dynasty|Song]] invasion of its nation.\n\n==Founding==\nAfter the assassination of the emperor, [[\u0110inh Ti\u00ean Ho\u00e0ng]], and the emperor's first son, [[\u0110inh Li\u1ec5n]], the third son of the emperor, [[\u0110inh Ph\u1ebf \u0110\u1ebf]], assumed the throne at aged six with the regent [[L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n]]. During the regency of L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n, members of the royal court skeptical of L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n's loyalty to the true emperor, such as the Duke of \u0110\u1ecbnh [[Nguy\u1ec5n B\u1eb7c]] and General \u0110inh \u0110i\u1ec1n, led an army to the imperial palace in an attempted coup. The failure of the undertaking caused those two figures to be executed. \nIn 980, the [[Song dynasty]] of [[China]] under [[Emperor Taizong of Song|Emperor Taizong]] ordered a Chinese army to invade \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. Because the young emperor was unable to lead the country to against the invader, the mandarins of the royal court discussed with Empress [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u00e2n Nga]] about enthroning the most trusted general and regent, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n. Most of them voted in the affirmative to this proposal; consequently, the empress dethroned her own son and gave the crown to L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n. He accepted the emperorship, establishing a new dynasty named the Early L\u00ea dynasty. L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n is often referred to with the [[posthumous name]] L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh.\n\n==L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh (980\u20131005)==\n{{further|Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (981)}}\nFollowing war threats from [[Song dynasty|Song China]], L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh made preparations for war while the Song forces advanced toward \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. Later at the [[Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (981)|Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River]], L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh's forces, under the command of General [[Ph\u1ea1m C\u1ef1 L\u01b0\u1ee3ng]], were successful at halting the overland advance of the Song forces, although they incurred some losses. Seeking peace, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh sent emissaries to negotiate for peace; thus the annual show of homage and offerings to the Celestial Emperor of China were resumed as a means to appease the Song dynasty.\n\nIn 982, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh began expeditions to [[Champa]], a nation south of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. \nL\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh's army met the combined forces of Champa, [[Chenla]] and [[Abbasid]] Mercenaries in \u0110\u1ed3 B\u00e0n, ([[Qu\u1ea3ng Nam]] province today) and be able to defeated all of them. Champa king [[Paramesvaravarman I]] had been beheaded and Champa capital of [[Indrapura]] was sacked by the Vietnamese. The new king of Champa agreed to be a [[Vassal state|vassal state]] of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t in 983.<ref>[[Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean]]: \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0 1.

Page. 222</ref>\n\nSome domestic achievements of L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh include constructing new monuments and galvanizing agricultural and handicraft production in order to make economic progress. Many spiritual etiquettes were developed, and L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh's government was the model for that of the succeeding dynasty.\nL\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh died in 1005 at the age of 65 and after 25 years of rule. In his will, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh gave the throne to his youngest son, L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t.\n\n==The succession crisis==\n===L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t (1005)===\nOut of his many princes, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n appointed his first prince [[L\u00ea Long Th\u00e2u]] as the crown prince in the early years of his rule. Th\u00e2u died in 1000, and L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n was forced to choose another crown prince.\nThe fifth prince Duke of Khai Minh, [[L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh]], nominated himself as crown prince. According to the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]], L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n viewed him as the favourable to become the next emperor, but royal court mandarins suggested him not to do it because they viewed other candidates as more viable. L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n followed the advice and chose his older brother L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7, the duke of Nam Phong.\nIn 1005, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n died after reigning for 24 years at Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Xu\u00e2n Palace.\nAfter the death, there was a succession dispute between the princes L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh, L\u00ea Long T\u00edch, and L\u00ea Long K\u00ednh and crown prince L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t, preventing a government to take control over the entire country for eight months. In the winter of 1005, L\u00ea Long T\u00edch was defeated by crown prince L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t. He fled to Th\u1ea1ch H\u00e0 province, now [[H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province]], and ordered the massacre of the locals there. After a few months, L\u00ea Long Vi\u1ec7t was able to proclaim himself emperor [[L\u00ea Trung T\u00f4ng (Early L\u00ea)|L\u00ea Trung T\u00f4ng]] but was assassinated after ruling for three days by L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh, who replaced him as emperor.\n\n===L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh (1005\u20131009)===\nL\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh mustered large military forces, defeating the other princes.\nAfter stabilizing his rule through war, he enhanced foreign relations with the [[Song dynasty]] with a gentle and friendly policy. The emperor gave full support for Buddhism and sought Chinese Buddhist canon and scripture for practice in Vietnam.\nHe also supervised the national economy and began the construction of bridges, roads, and other infrastructure for easy transportation of people and commodities, especially water. In 1009, he established the exchange of goods and products in [[Nanning]] with the [[Song dynasty]], albeit it was limited as the Song emperor only allowed Vietnamese businessmen to trade at specific locations near the border like [[Hepu County]], [[Guangxi]].\n\n====Hemorrhoids====\nThe emperor was famous for suffering from hemorrhoids, which made him unable to sit on the throne and instead forced him to lie on his throne. His famous lying sessions earned him the name [[L\u00ea Ng\u1ecda Tri\u1ec1u]] throughout his reign, meaning \"the one who rules while lying on the throne.\"<ref>[http://www.philosophy.ru/iphras/library/viet.html \u0410\u041d\u0422\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0413\u0418\u042f \u0422\u0420\u0410\u0414\u0418\u0426\u0418\u041e\u041d\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0412\u042c\u0415\u0422\u041d\u0410\u041c\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418.

Although Buddhism played a key role in his life and politics, the emperor often used Buddhist monks for so-called entertainment such as by exfoliating sugar canes atop a monk's head until it began to bleed. Employing many corrupt or otherwise incompetent officials into important court positions only further encouraged these tendencies of the emperor.\nAs a result of the emperor's poor health, according to some sources, most power was actually controlled by one of the members of the L\u00fd family [[L\u00fd C\u00f4ng U\u1ea9n]]. High resentment from the public and the imperial court culminated for a long period preceding L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh's death. After L\u00ea Long \u0110\u0129nh died the court agreed to enthrone the high-rank mandarin and aristocrat L\u00fd C\u00f4ng U\u1ea9n as the new emperor under pressure from the public and from the Buddhist monks, thus ending the Early L\u00ea Dynasty. In its place, the [[L\u00fd dynasty]] ushered in a new age for Vietnam, with a combination of Confucian and Buddhist influences recurring in the new dynasty.\n\n==Domestic==\n===Administrative centre===\nThe Early L\u00ea Dynasty dynasty modified the traditional government form of the [[\u0110inh dynasty]], although it modified some parts of it. In 980, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n appointed several men to court positions: [[H\u1ed3ng Hi\u1ebfn]] as the grand chancellor, known in Vietnamese as Th\u00e1i s\u01b0; [[Ph\u1ea1m C\u1ef1 L\u1ea1ng]] as the vice-chancellor, or Th\u00e1i \u00fay; [[T\u1eeb M\u1ee5c]] as grand governor of court, \u0110\u1ea1i t\u1ed5ng qu\u1ea3n; and [[\u0110inh Th\u1eeba Chinh]] as royal capital interior military commander, in Vietnamese Nha n\u1ed9i \u0111\u00f4 ch\u1ec9 huy s\u1ee9.\nA major reform, however, was the distribution of specific duties and powers to each mandarin in contrast to the \u0110inh dynasty's centralizing all power to the emperor.\n<ref name=\"dvsktb205\"/>\n[[File:Dinhyenthanh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Temple of \u0110\u00ecnh Y\u00ean Th\u00e0nh, [[Hoa L\u01b0]], [[Ninh B\u00ecnh]].]]\n\n===Rebellion oppression===\nIn the ruling era, L\u00ea emperors often faced the revolts of some local Tribal chief and viceroy, especially in remote areas, retaining the specific authorization to quell them.\nIn 980, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh ordered D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ti\u1ebfn L\u1ed9c to collect taxes from Hoan and \u00c1i province, now [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]] and [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province]]. However, D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ti\u1ebfn L\u1ed9c opposed it and seized the two provinces, proposing to place them under the control of the Kingdom of [[Champa]], which refused him in order to maintain a friendly relationship with \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh led an army to defeat and kill L\u1ed9c along with a general massacre of citizens in those two provinces.\nThis, however, is only an example of rebellion: there were more than ten rebellions against the royal court during a reign of five years.\n\n===Transportation===\nAfter victory over Champa in 983, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh merged the seized territory into the country and started to build more roads from the south estuary to [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]] at the south of his realm. Then he ordered the dredging of the \u0110a C\u00e1i canal in 1003. \nIn 1009, the country started the massive construction of transportation infrastructure for trading among the regions and to facilitate travel for soldiers heading south.\n\n===Economy===\n====Taxation====\nThe Early L\u00ea dynasty imposed taxation based on land property. Taxes included a public benefit tax, which was ten days' worth of labor for public projects; a household tax on property paid annually; and a military tax added to the household tax specifically for military operations, including public security at home. The taxation on property was borrowed from the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties of China, only collecting goods and not money. Simultaneously, the government implementing trade-promoting policies by not taxing the property of traders except for land owned.<ref name=\"bnlsvn80\" />\n\n====Agriculture====\nAgriculture was the fundamental element of the economy of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t during the Early L\u00ea dynasty. Most of the land of villages was under the control of the royal court and owned by it by law.\nLand was given one of four types. The emperor's land was cultivated with a spiritual significance, intended to have the people to take part in agricultural activities, mainly prisoners and peasants, with all products going to the royal court; it was first implemented by L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh in 987. Meanwhile, distributive land was distributed to mandarins for the benefiting and contributing to the country or to princes as an accommodation. It was not private property and was returned to the royal court when the landowner died. Religious land was set aside for the practices of Buddhist monks; private land was owned and sold freely between individuals without government interference. Besides that, the government encouraged subjects to exploit wild and untouched land by settling it, providing property at a lower cost while simultaneously expanding its influence in unsettled regions. Peasants shared the land equally and cultivate it, regularly paying taxes to the government for the government's budget.<ref name=\"dvsktt1\" />\n\n[[File:Dinhhoaxa-Minhngulau.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Temple of Hoa X\u00e1 \u2013 Minh Ng\u1ef1 L\u00e2u]]\n\n====Trade====\nThe emperors were focused on an open new trade route through roads and waterways. Records report that such infrastructure projects were undertaken mainly in the years 983, 1003, and 1009.\nThe main trade partner of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t was China, and both sides agreed to establish bilateral exchanging of goods at borders.\nSome local high officials supported commercial activity among local parties. A delegation of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t acted as a government arbitrator in trade disputes. Some typical exports of Vietnam were gold, silver, and bronze products.<ref name=\"thq112\">Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng H\u1eefu Qu\u00fdnh, \u0110inh Xu\u00e2n L\u00e2m, L\u00ea M\u1eadu H\u00e3n, s\u00e1ch \u0111\u00e3 d\u1eabn, tr 112</ref>\n\n====Culture====\nThere are not much sources describing the culture under Early L\u00ea dynasty. However, it is known that Buddhism was the most widespread religion, affecting the flourishing of Buddhism in China's [[Tang dynasty]]. Monks were given an elevated status in government affairs, being allowed to participate in politics and national planning.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n===Song dynasty===\n\u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t pretended to be a vassal state of the Song during the Early L\u00ea dynasty, although in reality it was an independent state, thereby simultaneously maintaining both peace with China and independence. L\u00ea emperors, however, were sometimes threatened by the nomadic [[Khitan people]] in the north of [[China]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cla.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/handbook/triet_hoc_chinh_tri.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110042938/http://www.cla.temple.edu/vietnamese_center/handbook/triet_hoc_chinh_tri.html |archive-date=2017-11-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter a [[Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (981)|failed invasion]] in 981, the Song emperor accepted L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n as the ruler of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t but just regarded him as the Jiedushi, or regional military governor, of the Annam protectorate, as the Chinese called the \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t.\nIn 986 and 987 and 990, Emperor Taizong of the Song continued to dispatch diplomatic envoys to \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. \nIn 995, the Song emperor Taizong granted L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n the title Duke of Giao Ch\u1ec9 (Chinese: Jiaozhi). \nIn 995 and 996, there was a rebellion of local officials and other discontents of both sides at the border. Song soldiers captured more than 100 people and returned them back to \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t, while \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t did the same by returning 27 people to the Song. Both sides expressed gratitude to the other. \nThus the relation of both nations could be seen as friendly.\n\n===Champa===\nThe relation of \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t in the north and Champa in the south was regarded as hostile. In 981, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh sent an envoy to Champa, who was captured by them. The diplomatic incident sparked a war between the two countries.\nIn 982, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n victoriously took part in the campaign against Champa, killing the Cham king at the battlefield. Then he sacked the capital of Cham and captured a hundred soldiers and concubines along with one Indian monk, taking home precious goods such as gold and silver. Moreover, he burned the fortresses and tombs of former Champa kings. \nIn 992, the Champa king Harivarman II sent an envoy to \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t to ask for the release of 360 prisoners back to the homeland.\n\n==References==\n* {{in lang|ru}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20111019134021/http://philosophy.ru/iphras/library/viet.html \u0410\u041d\u0422\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0413\u0418\u042f \u0422\u0420\u0410\u0414\u0418\u0426\u0418\u041e\u041d\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0412\u042c\u0415\u0422\u041d\u0410\u041c\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418.
