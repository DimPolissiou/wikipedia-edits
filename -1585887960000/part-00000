He also played in the NBA for the [[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans Hornets]], [[Golden State Warriors]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[New York Knicks]]. Davis played college basketball for [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]], where he was an [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|All-American]] honoree before turning professional after his sophomore year.

That year, Davis was also named [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade National Player of the Year]] and a [[Parade All-American]].

During this time, Davis was involved in a minor controversy pertaining to his driving a 1991 [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevy Blazer]] that was a gift from his sister, then a UCLA employee. The car was sold to her by a member of [[Jim Harrick]]'s family. At the time, Harrick was the UCLA men's basketball coach, presenting both a conflict of interest and a potential recruiting violation, since rumor had it that the car was purchased below market value. The controversy subsided when it was discovered that Davis's sister had, in fact, bought the car at the listed blue-book price. Davis then enrolled at UCLA in 1997 without problem. In 1998, Davis was named the [[Pac-12 Conference Men's Basketball Freshman of the Year|Pac-10 Freshman of the Year]] and made the [[1999 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|Third Team All-America his sophomore year]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Emmons |title=Warriors' leader Baron Davis has a Hollywood story |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_5831215?nclick_check=1 |work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=May 6, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509035608/http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_5831215?nclick_check=1 |archivedate=May 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn Davis's two years at UCLA, he averaged 13.6 points and 5.1 assists for the Bruins.

Although Davis suffered through knee soreness and underwent surgery during the season, he still led the Warriors to their first playoff appearance since [[1994 NBA playoffs|1994]]. The Warriors swept the regular season series against the Mavericks 3\u20130, giving them an advantage and won the series against the top-seeded [[Dallas Mavericks]] 4\u20132, making them the first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed since the NBA changed the 1st round from a 5-game series to a 7-game series.

During this time, Davis was involved in a minor controversy pertaining to his driving a 1991 [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevy Blazer]] that was a gift from his sister, then a UCLA employee. The car was sold to her by a member of [[Jim Harrick]]'s family. At the time, Harrick was the UCLA men's basketball coach, presenting both a conflict of interest and a potential recruiting violation, since rumor had it that the car was purchased below market value. The controversy subsided when it was discovered that Davis's sister had, in fact, bought the car at the listed blue-book price. Davis then enrolled at UCLA in 1997 without problem.

In 1938, the college became a constituent college of [[Rangoon University]]. Students who had passed the Intermediate of Science examination of the Rangoon University were admitted to the agricultural course and were conferred BSc ([[Agriculture]]) degree after two-year period of study. In 1947, the college was upgraded to the '''Faculty of Agriculture''' in Mandalay under the administration of Rangoon University. The two-year agricultural course was extended to three-year course in 1955 and BSc ([[Sericulture]]) degree was also awarded in that year.

The most popular of these was Gideon of Scotland Yard, who was the basis for the television series ''[[Gideon's Way]]'' and for the [[John Ford]] movie  ''[[Gideon's Day (film)|Gideon's Day]]'' (1958). The Baron character was also made into a 1960s TV series starring [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]] as ''[[The Baron]]''.\n\nI remember reading a non-fiction paperback book in the 1960s, which I believe was written by John Creasy. I thought it was very strange as he was a author of western books. It was a treatise on road deaths in Britain - about 20 a day I think at the time and his anger against this futile loss of life. One of his suggestions to help reduce casualties, was to institute a one way system around London. Can anyone confirm my memory?\n\n==Life and career==\n\nJohn Creasey was born in [[Southfields, Surrey]], to a working-class family. He was the seventh of nine children of Ruth and Joseph Creasey, a poor coach maker. Creasey was educated at Fulham Elementary School and Sloane School, both in London. From 1923 to 1935 he worked various clerical, factory, and sales jobs while trying to establish himself as a writer. After a number of rejections, Creasey's first book was published in 1930. His first crime novel, ''Seven Times Seven'', was published in January 1932 by Melrose. It was a story about a gang of criminals. In 1935 he became a full-time writer. In 1937 alone, twenty-nine of his books were published. A phenomenally fast writer, he once suggested that he could be shut up in a glass-box and write there a whole book.\n\nIn 1938, he created the character [[The Toff]] with the first novel ''Introducing the Toff''. The Toff series would continue for 59 novels from 1938 to 1978. The Toff, The Honourable Richard Rollison, is an aristocrat and an amateur sleuth. (\"Toff\" is a British slang expression for an aristocrat.)\n\nDuring World War II, he created the character of Dr. Stanislaus Alexander Palfrey, a British secret service agent, who forms Z5, a secret underground group that owes its allegiance to the Allies. The first novel of the Dr. Palfrey 34-book series was ''Traitor's Doom'', published in 1942 by John Long Ltd., while the last was ''The Whirlwind'' in 1979.\n\nSeveral adaptations were made of Creasey's novels. On film these included: ''Salute the Toff'' (1952, also known as ''Brighthaven Express'' in the USA), ''Hammer the Toff'' (1952), [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Gideon's Day (film)|Gideon's Day]]'' (1958, also known as ''Gideon of Scotland Yard'' in the USA), released by [[Columbia Pictures]], and ''[[Cat & Mouse (1958 film)|Cat & Mouse]]'' (1958, also known as ''The Desperate Men'' in the USA), written as Michael Halliday. On television, a series based on the Commander George Gideon character, ''[[Gideon's Way]]'', was produced from 1964 to 1965 by [[ITC Entertainment]] and starring [[John Gregson]] in the title r\u00f4le. ITC followed this with a version of Creasey's [[The Baron]] character (1965\u201366), starring [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]]. Between 1967 and 1971 the BBC produced a radio version of Creasey's Roger West stories with actor [[Patrick Allen]] in the title role as [[Scotland Yard]] [[Chief Inspector]] Roger \"Handsome\" West, with Allen's real-life wife [[Sarah Lawson (actress)|Sarah Lawson]] playing the role of West's wife Janet.\n\nIn 1962, Creasey won an [[Edgar Award]] for Best Novel, from the Mystery Writers of America (MWA), for ''Gideon's Fire'', written under the pseudonym J. J. Marric. In 1969 he received the MWA's greatest honour, the Grand Master Award. He served one term as president of the organization in 1966, one of only three non-American writers to be so honoured.\n\nCreasey had as many publishers as he had pseudonyms, but enjoyed enduring relations with John Long and [[Hodder & Stoughton]] in the UK. After he finally broke into the American market in the 1950s, many of his books were released by Harper and Scribners; Walker reissued many older titles in the revised editions.\n\nHe died at [[Salisbury]], Wiltshire in 1973.\n\nIn 2007, his family transferred all of Creasey's copyrights and other legal rights to Owatonna Media. Owatonna Media on-sold these copyrights to Coolabi Plc in 2009, but retained a master licence in radio and audio rights. These rights are commercially licensed in the UK and abroad.\n\n===Richard Creasey===\nJohn's son '''Richard Creasey''' is also an author as well as a distinguished television producer, having served both in the private sector and at the BBC, and as the British producer of [[Patrick Watson (producer)|Patrick Watson]]'s worldwide Canadian television documentary series ''The Struggle for Democracy''. He has developed his father's \"Doctor Palfrey\" series by penning a new series of techno-thrillers around the character of '''Doctor Thomas Palfrey'''.\n\n==Crime Writers' Association (CWA)==\n\nIn 1953, John Creasey founded the [[Crime Writers' Association]] (CWA) in the UK. The CWA New Blood Dagger is awarded in his memory, for first books by previously unpublished writers; sponsored by BBC Audiobooks, it includes a prize of \u00a31000. This award was known previously as the John Creasey Memorial Dagger.\n\n==Pseudonyms==\nHis pseudonyms include:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* ''Gordon Ashe''\n* ''Henry St. John Cooper''\n* ''Credo''\n* ''Norman Deane''\n* ''Robert Caine Frazer''\n* ''Patrick Gill''\n* ''Michael Halliday''\n{{col-3}}\n* ''Charles Hogarth'' (with Ian Bowen)\n* ''Brian Hope''\n* ''Colin Hughes''\n* ''Kyle Hunt''\n* ''Abel Mann''\n* ''Peter Manton''\n* ''J.J.

Reilly'', and ''Jimmy Wilde''. [[Romance novel|Romantic novels]] under the names of ''Margaret Cooke'', ''M.E. Cooke'', and ''Elise Fecamps''.\n\n==Political career==\n\nAs well as being an author, Creasey was a committed [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] party member though he later became an independent.<ref>\"Man of Mystery\", Ian Millsted, ''Journal of Liberal History'', Issue 57, Winter 2007\u201308</ref> He said that he had been organising Liberal street-corner meetings from the age of 12. At the time of the 1945 general election Creasey was Chairman of the local Liberal Association in Bournemouth where his publicity and writing skills were instrumental in helping the Liberals to an atypical second place. He was adopted as prospective parliamentary candidate for [[Bournemouth West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth West]] in 1946 and appeared on the platform at the 1947 [[Liberal Assembly]], which was held in Bournemouth.\n\nHe fought Bournemouth West in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], coming third. He became increasingly unhappy with the party through the 1950s though and disagreed so much with the party's policy concerning the [[Suez Crisis]] he resigned his membership. However, after the [[1962 Orpington by-election|Orpington by-election success of 1962]] and impressed with [[Jo Grimond]]'s leadership of the party he seemed to be reviving his Liberal activity. By January 1966 however, he had founded the All Party Alliance, a pressure group which sought to unite the best people from all parties.\n\nThe platform of the All Party Alliance was based on running industry by councils made up of workers, managers, investors and government to avoid industrial action, with a mind to eventually eliminate income tax.<ref>Man of Mystery, Ian Millsted, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 57, Winter 2007-08</ref>\n\nCreasey fought by-elections as an independent in support of this idea in 1967 at [[Nuneaton (UK Parliament constituency)|Nuneaton]], [[Brierley Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Brierley Hill]] and [[Manchester Gorton (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Gorton]].  He also fought [[Oldham West (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham West]] during the [[1968 Oldham West by-election|by-election]] of June 1968. He did well for an independent with the first-past-the-post system, having limited resources and often little time to campaign.\n\nIn Oldham West he beat his old party's candidate into fourth place. He could not seem to shed his affection for the Liberal party however, congratulating [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]] by-election victor [[Wallace Lawler]] in July 1969 and attending the 1969 party assembly albeit to promote All Party Alliance aims.\n\nIn 1972 he relaunched the All Party Alliance as Evolution to Democracy (Evo). Evo merged with Colin Campion's \"The Organisation\", a Yorkshire-based party which advocated coalition governments based on the proportion of votes cast for each party, to form the \"Independent Democratic Alliance\", which soon faded after Creasey's death, and its poor performance in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]].<ref name=\"craig\">[[F. W. S. Craig]], ''Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections''</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\nHe was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for services in the United Kingdom's [[National Savings and Investments|National Savings]] Movement during [[World War II]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{inc-lit}}\n\n=== The Commander George Gideon series (published under the pseudonym \"J.

The most popular of these was Gideon of Scotland Yard, who was the basis for the television series ''[[Gideon's Way]]'' and for the [[John Ford]] movie  ''[[Gideon's Day (film)|Gideon's Day]]'' (1958). The Baron character was also made into a 1960s TV series starring [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]] as ''[[The Baron]]''.\n\n==Life and career==\n\nJohn Creasey was born in [[Southfields, Surrey]], to a working-class family. He was the seventh of nine children of Ruth and Joseph Creasey, a poor coach maker. Creasey was educated at Fulham Elementary School and Sloane School, both in London. From 1923 to 1935 he worked various clerical, factory, and sales jobs while trying to establish himself as a writer. After a number of rejections, Creasey's first book was published in 1930. His first crime novel, ''Seven Times Seven'', was published in January 1932 by Melrose. It was a story about a gang of criminals. In 1935 he became a full-time writer. In 1937 alone, twenty-nine of his books were published. A phenomenally fast writer, he once suggested that he could be shut up in a glass-box and write there a whole book.\n\nIn 1938, he created the character [[The Toff]] with the first novel ''Introducing the Toff''. The Toff series would continue for 59 novels from 1938 to 1978. The Toff, The Honourable Richard Rollison, is an aristocrat and an amateur sleuth. (\"Toff\" is a British slang expression for an aristocrat.)\n\nDuring World War II, he created the character of Dr. Stanislaus Alexander Palfrey, a British secret service agent, who forms Z5, a secret underground group that owes its allegiance to the Allies. The first novel of the Dr. Palfrey 34-book series was ''Traitor's Doom'', published in 1942 by John Long Ltd., while the last was ''The Whirlwind'' in 1979.\n\nSeveral adaptations were made of Creasey's novels. On film these included: ''Salute the Toff'' (1952, also known as ''Brighthaven Express'' in the USA), ''Hammer the Toff'' (1952), [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Gideon's Day (film)|Gideon's Day]]'' (1958, also known as ''Gideon of Scotland Yard'' in the USA), released by [[Columbia Pictures]], and ''[[Cat & Mouse (1958 film)|Cat & Mouse]]'' (1958, also known as ''The Desperate Men'' in the USA), written as Michael Halliday. On television, a series based on the Commander George Gideon character, ''[[Gideon's Way]]'', was produced from 1964 to 1965 by [[ITC Entertainment]] and starring [[John Gregson]] in the title r\u00f4le. ITC followed this with a version of Creasey's [[The Baron]] character (1965\u201366), starring [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]]. Between 1967 and 1971 the BBC produced a radio version of Creasey's Roger West stories with actor [[Patrick Allen]] in the title role as [[Scotland Yard]] [[Chief Inspector]] Roger \"Handsome\" West, with Allen's real-life wife [[Sarah Lawson (actress)|Sarah Lawson]] playing the role of West's wife Janet.\n\nIn 1962, Creasey won an [[Edgar Award]] for Best Novel, from the Mystery Writers of America (MWA), for ''Gideon's Fire'', written under the pseudonym J. J. Marric. In 1969 he received the MWA's greatest honour, the Grand Master Award. He served one term as president of the organization in 1966, one of only three non-American writers to be so honoured.\n\nCreasey had as many publishers as he had pseudonyms, but enjoyed enduring relations with John Long and [[Hodder & Stoughton]] in the UK. After he finally broke into the American market in the 1950s, many of his books were released by Harper and Scribners; Walker reissued many older titles in the revised editions.\n\nHe died at [[Salisbury]], Wiltshire in 1973.\n\nIn 2007, his family transferred all of Creasey's copyrights and other legal rights to Owatonna Media. Owatonna Media on-sold these copyrights to Coolabi Plc in 2009, but retained a master licence in radio and audio rights. These rights are commercially licensed in the UK and abroad.\n\n===Richard Creasey===\nJohn's son '''Richard Creasey''' is also an author as well as a distinguished television producer, having served both in the private sector and at the BBC, and as the British producer of [[Patrick Watson (producer)|Patrick Watson]]'s worldwide Canadian television documentary series ''The Struggle for Democracy''. He has developed his father's \"Doctor Palfrey\" series by penning a new series of techno-thrillers around the character of '''Doctor Thomas Palfrey'''.\n\n==Crime Writers' Association (CWA)==\n\nIn 1953, John Creasey founded the [[Crime Writers' Association]] (CWA) in the UK. The CWA New Blood Dagger is awarded in his memory, for first books by previously unpublished writers; sponsored by BBC Audiobooks, it includes a prize of \u00a31000. This award was known previously as the John Creasey Memorial Dagger.\n\n==Pseudonyms==\nHis pseudonyms include:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* ''Gordon Ashe''\n* ''Henry St. John Cooper''\n* ''Credo''\n* ''Norman Deane''\n* ''Robert Caine Frazer''\n* ''Patrick Gill''\n* ''Michael Halliday''\n{{col-3}}\n* ''Charles Hogarth'' (with Ian Bowen)\n* ''Brian Hope''\n* ''Colin Hughes''\n* ''Kyle Hunt''\n* ''Abel Mann''\n* ''Peter Manton''\n* ''J.J.

Reilly'', and ''Jimmy Wilde''. [[Romance novel|Romantic novels]] under the names of ''Margaret Cooke'', ''M.E. Cooke'', and ''Elise Fecamps''.\n\n==Political career==\n\nAs well as being an author, Creasey was a committed [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] party member though he later became an independent.<ref>\"Man of Mystery\", Ian Millsted, ''Journal of Liberal History'', Issue 57, Winter 2007\u201308</ref> He said that he had been organising Liberal street-corner meetings from the age of 12. At the time of the 1945 general election Creasey was Chairman of the local Liberal Association in Bournemouth where his publicity and writing skills were instrumental in helping the Liberals to an atypical second place. He was adopted as prospective parliamentary candidate for [[Bournemouth West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth West]] in 1946 and appeared on the platform at the 1947 [[Liberal Assembly]], which was held in Bournemouth.\n\nHe fought Bournemouth West in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], coming third. He became increasingly unhappy with the party through the 1950s though and disagreed so much with the party's policy concerning the [[Suez Crisis]] he resigned his membership. However, after the [[1962 Orpington by-election|Orpington by-election success of 1962]] and impressed with [[Jo Grimond]]'s leadership of the party he seemed to be reviving his Liberal activity. By January 1966 however, he had founded the All Party Alliance, a pressure group which sought to unite the best people from all parties.\n\nThe platform of the All Party Alliance was based on running industry by councils made up of workers, managers, investors and government to avoid industrial action, with a mind to eventually eliminate income tax.<ref>Man of Mystery, Ian Millsted, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 57, Winter 2007-08</ref>\n\nCreasey fought by-elections as an independent in support of this idea in 1967 at [[Nuneaton (UK Parliament constituency)|Nuneaton]], [[Brierley Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Brierley Hill]] and [[Manchester Gorton (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Gorton]].  He also fought [[Oldham West (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham West]] during the [[1968 Oldham West by-election|by-election]] of June 1968. He did well for an independent with the first-past-the-post system, having limited resources and often little time to campaign.\n\nIn Oldham West he beat his old party's candidate into fourth place. He could not seem to shed his affection for the Liberal party however, congratulating [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]] by-election victor [[Wallace Lawler]] in July 1969 and attending the 1969 party assembly albeit to promote All Party Alliance aims.\n\nIn 1972 he relaunched the All Party Alliance as Evolution to Democracy (Evo). Evo merged with Colin Campion's \"The Organisation\", a Yorkshire-based party which advocated coalition governments based on the proportion of votes cast for each party, to form the \"Independent Democratic Alliance\", which soon faded after Creasey's death, and its poor performance in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]].<ref name=\"craig\">[[F. W. S. Craig]], ''Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections''</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\nHe was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for services in the United Kingdom's [[National Savings and Investments|National Savings]] Movement during [[World War II]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{inc-lit}}\n\n=== The Commander George Gideon series (published under the pseudonym \"J.

Its historic seat and capital was [[Lidzbark Warmi\u0144ski|Lidzbark]] and the largest city is [[Olsztyn]]. \n\nIt is now the core of the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]]. It has about 4,500&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and 350,000 inhabitants. The most notable settlements include Olsztyn (Allenstein) and Lidzbark Warmi\u0144ski (Heilsberg), however, in the past the largest town was [[Braniewo]] (Braunsberg). Important landmarks include the [[Cathedral Hill, Frombork|Cathedral Hill]] in [[Frombork]] (Frauenburg), where [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] elaborated the [[heliocentric theory]], the castles of the Warmian bishops in Olsztyn, Lidzbark Castle, the medieval town of [[Reszel]] (R\u00f6\u00dfel) and sanctuary in [[Gietrzwa\u0142d]] (Dietrichswalde), a site of [[Marian apparitions]] and [[miracle]]s. It is an area of many lakes and lies at the upper [[\u0141yna river]] and on the right bank of [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], stretching in the northwest to the [[Vistula Bay]]. Warmia has a number of architectural monuments ranging from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] to [[Neoclassical architecture|Classicism]], Historicism and Art Nouveau.\n\nWarmia is part of a larger historical region called [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], which was inhabited by the [[Old Prussians]] and later on was populated mainly by Germans and Poles.<ref>[http://deacademic.com/pictures/dewiki/80/Polska1912.jpg Linguistic map Poland 1912] </ref>  Warmia has traditionally strong connections with neighbouring [[Masuria]], but it remained Catholic and belonged to Poland between 1454/1466 and 1772, whereas Masuria became part of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] and became predominantly Protestant. Warmia has been under the dominion of various states over the course of its history, most notably the [[Old Prussians]], the [[Teutonic Knights]], the [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The history of the region is closely connected to that of the [[Archbishopric of Warmia]] (formerly, [[Duchy of Warmia]]). The region is associated with the [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] tribe, the [[Warmians]],<ref name=\"Warm names\">Also called the  ''Warms'', ''Varms'', ''Varmi'', ''Warmians'', ''Varmians''.</ref> who settled in an approximate area. According to [[folk etymology]], Warmia is named after the legendary Prussian chief [[Warmo]], and Ermland derives from his widow Erma.\n[[File:Prusy historyczne.png|thumb|220px|Map of historical lands and regions in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]]]\n==History==\n\n=== Early times ===\n[[Image:Prussian clans 13th century.png|thumb|220px|right|Warmians and other Prussian tribes during the 13th century]]\nBy the early [[Middle Ages]] the Warmians, an [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] tribe, inhabited the area.\n\n=== Beginning of the Northern Crusades ===\nIn the 13th century the area became a battleground in the [[Northern Crusades]]. Having failed to gather an expedition against Palestine, [[Pope Innocent III]] resolved in 1207 to organize a new crusade; beginning in 1209, he called for crusades against the [[Albigenses]], against the [[Almohad dynasty]] of [[Spain]] (1213), and, also around that time, against the pagans of [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]].<ref>\n[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04543c.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Crusades] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917025303/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04543c.htm |date=2014-09-17 }}\n</ref> The first [[Bishops of Prussia|Bishop of Prussia]], [[Christian of Oliva]], was commissioned in 1209 to convert the Prussians, at the request of [[Konrad I of Masovia]] (duke from 1194 to 1247).\n\n=== Teutonic Order ===\nIn 1226 Duke Konrad I of Masovia invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to [[Christianize]] the pagan Prussians. He supplied the Teutonic Order and allowed the usage of [[Che\u0142mno Land]] (''Culmerland'') as a base for the knights. They had the task of establishing secure borders between Masovia and the Prussians, with the assumption that conquered territories would become part of Masovia. The Order waited until they received official authorisation from the Empire, which Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] granted by issuing the [[Golden Bull of Rimini]] (March 1226). The papal [[Golden Bull of Rieti]] from [[Pope Gregory IX]] in 1234 confirmed the grant, although Konrad of Masovia never recognized the rights of the Order to rule Prussia. Later, the Knights were accused{{by whom|date=December 2013}} of forging these land grants.\n\nBy the end of the 13th century the Teutonic Order had conquered and Christianized most of the [[Prussia (region)|Prussian region]], including Warmia. The new r\u00e9gime reduced many of the native Prussians to the status of serfs and gradually [[Germanization|Germanized]] them. Over several centuries the colonists, native Prussians and immigrants gradually intermingled.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn 1242 the [[papal legate]] [[William of Modena]] set up four [[diocese]]s, including the [[Archbishopric of Warmia]]. From the 13th century new colonists, mainly [[Germans]], settled in the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]] (with Warmia) (the  [[Duchy of Prussia]], [[Lutheran]] from 1525 onwards, granted refuge to Protestant [[Poles]], Lithuanians, Scots and Salzburgers).

The Estates of Royal Prussia did not take the side of the Cathedral Chapter. Nicholas von T\u00fcngen allied himself with the [[Teutonic Order]] and with King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]]. The feud, known as the [[War of the Priests (Poland)|War of the Priests]], was a low scale affair, affecting mainly Warmia. In 1478 [[Braniewo]] (Braunsberg) withstood a Polish siege which was ended in an agreement in which the Polish king recognized von T\u00fcngen as bishop and the right of the Cathedral Chapter to elect future bishops, which however would have to be accepted by the king, and the bishop as well as Cathedral Chapter swore an oath to the Polish king.

Its historic seat and capital was [[Lidzbark Warmi\u0144ski|Lidzbark]] and currently the largest city is [[Olsztyn]]. \n\nIt is now the core of the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]].

Warmia has a number of architectural monuments ranging from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] to [[Neoclassical architecture|Classicism]], Historicism and Art Nouveau.\n\nWarmia is part of a larger historical region called [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], which was inhabited by the [[Old Prussians]] and later on was populated mainly by Germans and Poles.<ref>[http://deacademic.com/pictures/dewiki/80/Polska1912.jpg Linguistic map Poland 1912] </ref>  Warmia has traditionally strong connections with neighbouring [[Masuria]], but it remained Catholic and belonged to Poland between 1454/1466 and 1772, whereas Masuria became part of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] and became predominantly Protestant. Warmia has been under the dominion of various states over the course of its history, most notably the [[Old Prussians]], the [[Teutonic Knights]], the [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The history of the region is closely connected to that of the [[Archbishopric of Warmia]] (formerly, [[Duchy of Warmia]]). The region is associated with the [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] tribe, the [[Warmians]],<ref name=\"Warm names\">Also called the  ''Warms'', ''Varms'', ''Varmi'', ''Warmians'', ''Varmians''.</ref> who settled in an approximate area. According to [[folk etymology]], Warmia is named after the legendary Prussian chief [[Warmo]], and Ermland derives from his widow Erma.\n[[File:Prusy historyczne.png|thumb|220px|Map of historical lands and regions in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]]]\n==History==\n\n=== Early times ===\n[[Image:Prussian clans 13th century.png|thumb|220px|right|Warmians and other Prussian tribes during the 13th century]]\nBy the early [[Middle Ages]] the Warmians, an [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] tribe, inhabited the area.\n\n=== Beginning of the Northern Crusades ===\nIn the 13th century the area became a battleground in the [[Northern Crusades]]. Having failed to gather an expedition against Palestine, [[Pope Innocent III]] resolved in 1207 to organize a new crusade; beginning in 1209, he called for crusades against the [[Albigenses]], against the [[Almohad dynasty]] of [[Spain]] (1213), and, also around that time, against the pagans of [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]].<ref>\n[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04543c.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Crusades] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917025303/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04543c.htm |date=2014-09-17 }}\n</ref> The first [[Bishops of Prussia|Bishop of Prussia]], [[Christian of Oliva]], was commissioned in 1209 to convert the Prussians, at the request of [[Konrad I of Masovia]] (duke from 1194 to 1247).\n\n=== Teutonic Order ===\nIn 1226 Duke Konrad I of Masovia invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to [[Christianize]] the pagan Prussians. He supplied the Teutonic Order and allowed the usage of [[Che\u0142mno Land]] (''Culmerland'') as a base for the knights. They had the task of establishing secure borders between Masovia and the Prussians, with the assumption that conquered territories would become part of Masovia. The Order waited until they received official authorisation from the Empire, which Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] granted by issuing the [[Golden Bull of Rimini]] (March 1226). The papal [[Golden Bull of Rieti]] from [[Pope Gregory IX]] in 1234 confirmed the grant, although Konrad of Masovia never recognized the rights of the Order to rule Prussia. Later, the Knights were accused{{by whom|date=December 2013}} of forging these land grants.\n\nBy the end of the 13th century the Teutonic Order had conquered and Christianized most of the [[Prussia (region)|Prussian region]], including Warmia. The new r\u00e9gime reduced many of the native Prussians to the status of serfs and gradually [[Germanization|Germanized]] them. Over several centuries the colonists, native Prussians and immigrants gradually intermingled.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn 1242 the [[papal legate]] [[William of Modena]] set up four [[diocese]]s, including the [[Archbishopric of Warmia]]. From the 13th century new colonists, mainly [[Germans]], settled in the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]] (with Warmia) (the  [[Duchy of Prussia]], [[Lutheran]] from 1525 onwards, granted refuge to Protestant [[Poles]], Lithuanians, Scots and Salzburgers). The bishopric was exempt and was governed by a [[prince-bishop]], confirmed by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. The [[Bishop of Warmia|Bishops of Warmia]] were usually Germans or Poles, although Enea Silvio Piccolomini, the later [[Pope Pius II]], served as an [[Italians|Italian]] bishop of the diocese.\n\nAfter the 1410 [[Battle of Grunwald]], Bishop [[Heinrich Vogelsang]] of Warmia surrendered to King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] of Poland, and later with Bishop [[Henry of Sambia]] gave homage to the Polish king at the Polish camp during the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|siege of Marienburg Castle (Malbork)]]. After the Polish army moved out of Warmia, the new Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, [[Heinrich von Plauen the Elder]], accused the bishop of treachery and reconquered the region.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.pieniezno.pl/?site=historia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614200207/http://pieniezno.pl/?site=historia |archivedate=2006-06-14 }}</ref>\n\n=== Polish Crown ===\n[[Image:Warmia1.jpg|thumb|220px|Map of ''Episcopatum Warmiensem in Prussia'' by [[Johann Friedrich Endersch|Endersch]], 1755.

The Estates of Royal Prussia did not take the side of the Cathedral Chapter. Nicholas von T\u00fcngen allied himself with the [[Teutonic Order]] and with King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]]. The feud, known as the [[War of the Priests (Poland)|War of the Priests]], was a low scale affair, affecting mainly Warmia. In 1478 [[Braniewo]] (Braunsberg) withstood a Polish siege which was ended in an agreement in which the Polish king recognized von T\u00fcngen as bishop and the right of the Cathedral Chapter to elect future bishops, which however would have to be accepted by the king, and the bishop as well as Cathedral Chapter swore an oath to the Polish king. Later in the [[Treaty of Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Treaty]] of [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski]] (December 7, 1512), conceded to the king of Poland a limited right to determine the election of bishops by choosing four candidates from Royal Prussia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/15cen/pfaffenkrieg14671479.html|title=WHKMLA :  Royal Prussia : Warmia Stift Feud (Pfaffenkrieg), 1467-1479|website=www.zum.de|accessdate=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204042926/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/15cen/pfaffenkrieg14671479.html|archivedate=4 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 [[Duchy of Warmia]] was officially directly included as part of the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Polish crown]] within the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. At the same time the territory continued to enjoy substantial autonomy, with many legal differences from neighbouring lands. For example, the bishops were by law members of [[Poland|Polish]] [[Senate|Senat]] and the land elected MP's to the [[Sejmik]] resp. [[Landtag]] of [[Royal Prussia]] as well as MP's to the [[Sejm#Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Sejm]] of [[Poland]].\n[[File:Lidzbark Warminski July 2013 36.JPG|thumb|The Grabowski Palace in [[Lidzbark Warmi\u0144ski]], the capital of Warmia until the [[Partitions of Poland]]]]\nWarmia was under the Church jurisdiction of the [[Archbishopric of Riga]] until 1512, when [[Prince-Bishop]] [[Lucas Watzenrode the Younger|Lucas Watzenrode]] received exempt status, placing Warmia directly under the authority of the Pope (in terms of church jurisdiction), which remained until the resolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806.\n\n=== Prussia ===\nBy the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, Warmia was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]; the properties of the [[Archbishopric of Warmia]] were secularized by the Prussian state. In 1773 Warmia was merged with the surrounding areas into the newly established province of [[East Prussia]]. [[Ignacy Krasicki]], the last [[prince-bishop]] of Warmia as well as [[Enlightenment in Poland|Enlightenment]] Polish poet, friend of [[Frederick the Great]] (whom he did not give [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] as his new king), was nominated to the Archbishopric of [[Gniezno|Gnesen (Gniezno)]] in 1795. After the last partition of Poland and during his tenure as Archbishop of Poland and Prussian subject he was ordered by [[Pope Pius VI]] to teach his Catholic Poles to 'stay obedient, faithful, and loving to their new kings', [[Papal brief]] of 1795. The Prussian census in 1772 showed a total population of 96,547, including an urban population of 24,612 in 12 towns. 17,749 houses were listed and the biggest city was [[Braniewo|Braunsberg (Braniewo)]].\n\nBetween 1773 and 1945 Warmia was part of the predominantly [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] province of [[East Prussia]], with the exception that the people of Warmia remained largely [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]. Most of the population of Warmia spoke [[High Prussian|High Prussian German]] , while a small area in the north spoke [[Low Prussian|Low Prussian German]]; southern Warmia was mostly populated by Polish-speaking [[Warmiak]]s <ref> Nationale Minderheiten und staatliche Minderheitenpolitik in Deutschland im 19.

In 1900 Warmia's population was 240,000. In the [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] climate after [[World War I]], Warmian Poles were subject to persecution by the German government.

In 1975 this voivodeship was redistricted and survived in this form until the new redistricting and renaming in 1999 as Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship.
