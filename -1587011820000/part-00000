Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live

They achieved further chart success in the UK, attaining top-ten hit singles in 1985 with \"[[Kayleigh]]\" and \"[[Lavender (Marillion song)|Lavender]]\", and again in 1987 with \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\". In 1988, Fish left Marillion to pursue a solo career.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Lyrics from the song \"[[Kayleigh]]\" were etched into paving stones in Market Square in [[Galashiels]] in 2012; the lines \u2018stilettoes in the snow\u2019, and \u2018moon-washed college halls\u2019 were inspired by Fish\u2019s girlfriend of the time who was at the Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels in the 1980s.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Solo career==\nMany of Fish's later works contain lengthy [[spoken word]] lyrics, shorter examples of which can be heard on earlier Marillion albums. Fish has collaborated with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] founder [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on his ''[[Still (Tony Banks album)|Still]]'' and ''[[Soundtracks (Tony Banks album)|Soundtracks]]'' albums, singing on the tracks \"Shortcut to Somewhere\", \"Angel Face\" and \"Another Murder of a Day\", co-writing the latter.\n\nFish appeared at World Bowl XI, 14 June 2003, Hampden Park, Glasgow. His performance included a rousing rendition of \"Caledonia\" before kick-off.\n\nOn 26 August 2007, Fish performed at the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' show at the Market Square in [[Aylesbury]]. He was accompanied on stage by his four former Marillion bandmates from the classic line-up ([[Mark Kelly (keyboardist)|Mark Kelly]], [[Steve Rothery]], [[Ian Mosley]] and [[Pete Trewavas]]) for one song: '[[Market Square Heroes]]'. This was the first time they had performed together in nearly two decades.

He also performed \"Grendel\", a fan-favourite Marillion b-side, twice.\n\n==Musical style==\nFish has sometimes been compared to [[Peter Gabriel]], original lead singer of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] in the early 1970s, and his voice has even been described as \"uncannily close\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Borthwick |first=Stuart |title=Popular Music Genres: An Introduction |year=2004|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-1745-6}} \"Their vocalist Fish (Derek Dick) had a voice uncannily close to Peter Gabriel's\"</ref> Music journalist [[David Hepworth]] described his voice as a \"conflation of [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]\".<ref name=\"Hepworth\"/> Fish has acknowledged Gabriel's influence on him and some vocal similarities, but has rejected accusations from some critics during his career that he does not have a unique voice of his own.<ref name=\"prasad\"/> [[Peter Hammill]] of [[Van der Graaf Generator]] was also a major influence on his songwriting and vocal delivery, which is especially notable on the first two Marillion albums.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Record labels==\nFollowing a legal dispute with [[EMI Records]] and an unsuccessful contract with [[Polydor]], Fish established the Dick Bros Record Company in [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] in 1993. The studio recorded ''In Amber'' by [[Dream Disciples]] (1994) and ''Man Dancin'' by [[Tam White]] in (1996). He released a number of \"official [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]\" albums to finance the company before selling it to [[Roadrunner Records]]. Another financially unsuccessful period followed before he re-established his own Chocolate Frog Records label in 2001. He signed with [[Snapper Music]] in 2005, but later returned to Chocolate Frog Records.\n\n==Awards==\nIn May 2008, Fish's Planet Rock show ''Fish on Friday'' won the Silver award in the Music Broadcaster of the Year category at the UK Sony Radio Academy Awards 2008.<ref name=\"Fish wins Silver in 2008 Sony Radio Academy Awards\">{{cite web |title=Fish wins Silver in 2008 Sony Radio Academy Awards |url=http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Music_Broadcaster_of_the_Year&year=2008 |accessdate=6 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414000640/http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Music_Broadcaster_of_the_Year&year=2008 |archive-date=14 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In June 2008, at the New York Festivals Radio Broadcasting Awards, he and [[Gary Moore]] jointly received the Gold World Medal in the Regularly Scheduled Music Programme category for their respective shows on Planet Rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/res/pdf/2008WinnersBookletRB.pdf |title=Newyorkfestivals.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Acting==\nFish was offered and accepted a part in the 1986 film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' (for which Marillion were also offered the soundtrack) but he eventually had to turn it down, owing to his tour commitments with the band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wall |first=Mick |title=Appetite for Destruction: Legendary Encounters with Mick Wall|year=2010|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-1-4091-2169-5}}</ref> Fish first appeared on terrestrial television as himself in the \"More Bad News\" episode of the series \"[[The Comic Strip Presents...]]\" in 1988.\n\nHis first acting role was as a guest star in an episode of \"[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]\" called \"The Newcomers\" (aired 10 February 1991) but a more prominent role was as the thug \"Ferguson\" alongside [[John Sessions]] in ''Jute City'', a four-part 1991 BBC drama based on a group of [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ruffians.\n\nIn 1994, he appeared in ''[[Chasing the Deer]]'', a film set during the [[1745 Jacobite rebellion]], as \"Angus Cameron\".

Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live

{"title_page": "Daily fantasy sports", "text_new": "{{About|daily fantasy sports|fantasy sports in general|Fantasy sport}}\n{{good article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2016}}\n'''Daily fantasy sports''' ('''DFS''') are a subset of [[fantasy sport]] games. As with traditional fantasy sports games, players compete against others by building a team of [[professional athlete]]s from a particular [[sports league|league]] or competition while remaining under a [[salary cap]], and earn points based on the actual statistical performance of the players in real-world competitions. Daily fantasy sports are an accelerated variant of traditional fantasy sports that are conducted over short-term periods, such as a week or single day of competition, as opposed to those that are played across an entire season. Daily fantasy sports are typically structured in the form of paid competitions typically referred to as a \"contest\"; winners receive a share of a pre-determined pot funded by their entry fees. A portion of entry fee payments go to the provider as [[Rake (poker)|rake]] revenue.<ref name=sg-dk500k>{{cite web|title=$500,000 DraftKings 1-Day Fantasy Baseball Contest Could Make You Rich Overnight|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/uncategorized/500000-draftkings-1-day-fantasy-baseball-contest-could-make-you-rich-overnight/|website=[[SportsGrid]]|publisher=Anthem Media Group|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=washington1>{{cite web|last1=Kilgore|first1=Adam|title=Daily fantasy sports Web sites find riches in Internet gaming law loophole|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/daily-fantasy-sports-web-sites-find-riches-in-internet-gaming-law-loophole/2015/03/27/92988444-d172-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=March 27, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the daily fantasy sports industry is dominated by two competing services: the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[FanDuel]], and the [[Boston]]-based [[DraftKings]]. Both companies were established as [[venture capital]]-backed [[startup company|startup companies]], received funding from investment firms, sports broadcasters, leagues, and team owners, and became known for the aggressive marketing of their services. As of September 2015, both companies have an estimated value of at least $1 billion, and control 95% of the  U.S. DFS market.<ref name=adage-dkspending/><ref name=wsj-realitycheck>{{cite web|title=Daily Fantasy-Sports Operators Await Reality Check|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/daily-fantasy-sports-operators-await-reality-check-1441835630|accessdate=October 15, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 9, 2015}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The two primarily compete against smaller DFS services, such as DRAFT, Fantasy Aces, and [[Yahoo!

Daily fantasy has also been credited with helping to improve television viewership and engagement with sports.\n\nDaily fantasy sports have faced notable legal challenges, including disputes over whether DFS constitutes [[gambling]]. Politicians and other critics have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making [[proposition bet|proposition wagers]] on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing the performance of their selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a [[game of skill]], as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.\n\nIn the United States, the legality of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of [[state attorneys general]] issued opinions concluding that DFS is a form of gambling, while the state of [[Nevada]] declared that DFS games must be licensed as a [[sports pool]]. The [[New York State]] lawsuit, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used [[inside information]] to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. By December 2017, 18 states, including [[Massachusetts]] and [[Virginia]], had ruled that DFS was a legal game of skill.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gouker |first=Dustin |url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/16802/ohio-sends-fantasy-sports-bill-governor/ |title=Ohio Sends Fantasy Sports Bill To Governor; Would Be 18th State With Law |work=Legal Sports Report |date=2017-12-05 |accessdate=2017-12-09 }}</ref> \n\n== Gameplay ==\nThere are several main disciplines of daily fantasy sports competitions, divided into two categories: cash games, and guaranteed prize pool (GPP).<ref name=washington1 /><ref name=\"rotoworld-cashvsgpp\"/><ref name=sbj-pushes>{{cite web|title=Daily fantasy pushes to continue growth streak|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/03/16/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/Daily-fantasy.aspx|accessdate=October 8, 2015|work=Sports Business Journal}}</ref> DFS contests typically utilize a [[salary cap]] format, in which players are allotted a maximum budget to spend on athletes for their team, represented as either [[play money]] or points.

As with traditional fantasy sports games, players compete against others by building a team of [[professional athlete]]s from a particular [[sports league|league]] or competition while remaining under a [[salary cap]], and earn points based on the actual statistical performance of the players in real-world competitions. Daily fantasy sports are an accelerated variant of traditional fantasy sports that are conducted over short-term periods, such as a week or single day of competition, as opposed to those that are played across an entire season. Daily fantasy sports are typically structured in the form of paid competitions typically referred to as a \"contest\"; winners receive a share of a pre-determined pot funded by their entry fees. A portion of entry fee payments go to the provider as [[Rake (poker)|rake]] revenue.<ref name=sg-dk500k>{{cite web|title=$500,000 DraftKings 1-Day Fantasy Baseball Contest Could Make You Rich Overnight|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/uncategorized/500000-draftkings-1-day-fantasy-baseball-contest-could-make-you-rich-overnight/|website=[[SportsGrid]]|publisher=Anthem Media Group|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=washington1>{{cite web|last1=Kilgore|first1=Adam|title=Daily fantasy sports Web sites find riches in Internet gaming law loophole|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/daily-fantasy-sports-web-sites-find-riches-in-internet-gaming-law-loophole/2015/03/27/92988444-d172-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=March 27, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the daily fantasy sports industry is dominated by two competing services: the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[FanDuel]], and the [[Boston]]-based [[DraftKings]].

Daily fantasy has also been credited with helping to improve television viewership and engagement with sports.\n\nDaily fantasy sports have faced notable legal challenges, including disputes over whether DFS constitutes [[gambling]]. Politicians and other critics have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making [[proposition bet|proposition wagers]] on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing the performance of their selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a [[game of skill]], as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.\n\nIn the United States, the legality of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of [[state attorneys general]] issued opinions concluding that DFS is a form of gambling, while the state of [[Nevada]] declared that DFS games must be licensed as a [[sports pool]]. The [[New York State]] lawsuit, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used [[inside information]] to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. By December 2017, 18 states, including [[Massachusetts]] and [[Virginia]], had ruled that DFS was a legal game of skill.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gouker |first=Dustin |url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/16802/ohio-sends-fantasy-sports-bill-governor/ |title=Ohio Sends Fantasy Sports Bill To Governor; Would Be 18th State With Law |work=Legal Sports Report |date=2017-12-05 |accessdate=2017-12-09 }}</ref> \n\n== Gameplay ==\nThere are several main disciplines of daily fantasy sports competitions, divided into two categories: cash games, and guaranteed prize pool (GPP).<ref name=washington1 /><ref name=\"rotoworld-cashvsgpp\"/><ref name=sbj-pushes>{{cite web|title=Daily fantasy pushes to continue growth streak|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/03/16/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/Daily-fantasy.aspx|accessdate=October 8, 2015|work=Sports Business Journal}}</ref> DFS contests typically utilize a [[salary cap]] format, in which players are allotted a maximum budget to spend on athletes for their team, represented as either [[play money]] or points.
