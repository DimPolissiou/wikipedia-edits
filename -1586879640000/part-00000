Maithili is also one of the names of [[Sita]], the wife of King [[Rama]] and daughter of King [[Janaka]]. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk ([[Abahatta]]).\n\nThe beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the '[[Charyapada|Charyapadas]]', a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in [[Twilight language|Sandhya bhasa]] by several Siddhas who belonged to [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and were scattered throughout the territory of [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Several of Siddas were from Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan|Rahul Sankrityanan]], Subhadra Jha and [[Jayakant Mishra]] provided evidences and proved that the language of  [[Charyapada]] is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135722 |title=A History Of Maithili Literature |volume=1 |last=Mishra|first=J. |date=1949}}</ref>\nApart from Charyapadas, there has been rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among common folks of Mithila region.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the fall of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rule, disappearance of [[Buddhism]], establishment of [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karn\u0101ta]] kings and patronage of Maithili under Harasimhadeva (1226\u20131324) of Karn\u0101ta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD).

But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until [[Vidyapati|Vidyapati Thakur]] (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] sect of [[Bengal]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]], out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym [[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali|Bhanusimha]].

The use of Maithili language was revived through personal efforts of MM Parameshvar Mishra, Chanda Jha, Munshi Raghunandan Das and others.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nPublication of ''Maithil Hita Sadhana'' (1905), ''Mithila Moda'' (1906), and ''Mithila Mihir'' (1908) further encouraged writers. The first social organization, Maithil Mahasabha, was established in 1910 for the development of Mithila and Maithili. It blocked its membership for people outside from the Maithil Brahmin and Karna Kayastha castes. Maithil Mahasabha campaigned for the official recognition of Maithili as a regional language. [[Calcutta University]] recognized Maithili in 1917, and other universities followed suit.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nBabu Bhola Lal Das wrote ''Maithili Grammar'' (''Maithili Vyakaran''). He edited a book ''Gadyakusumanjali'' and edited a journal ''Maithili''.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\nIn 1965, Maithili was officially accepted by [[Sahitya Academy]], an organization dedicated to the promotion of Indian literature.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 2002, Maithili was recognized on the VIII schedule of the Indian Constitution as a major Indian language; Maithili is now one of the twenty two national languages of India.<ref name=Singh2011>Singh, P. & Singh, A.

Maithili is also one of the names of [[Sita]], the wife of King [[Rama]] and daughter of King [[Janaka]]. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk ([[Abahatta]]).\n\nThe beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the '[[Charyapada|Charyapadas]]', a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in [[Twilight language|Sandhya bhasa]] by several Siddhas who belonged to [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and were scattered throughout the territory of [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Several of Siddas were from Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan|Rahul Sankrityanan]], Subhadra Jha and [[Jayakant Mishra]] provided evidences and proved that the language of  [[Charyapada]] is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135722 |title=A History Of Maithili Literature |volume=1 |last=Mishra|first=J. |date=1949}}</ref>\nApart from Charyapadas, there has been rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among common folks of Mithila region.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the fall of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rule, disappearance of [[Buddhism]], establishment of [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karn\u0101ta]] kings and patronage of Maithili under Harasimhadeva (1226\u20131324) of Karn\u0101ta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD).

But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until [[Vidyapati|Vidyapati Thakur]] (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] sect of [[Bengal]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]], out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym [[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali|Bhanusimha]]. Vidyapati influenced the religious literature of Asama, Bangal, Utkala and gave birth to a new [[Brajabuli]] language.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe earliest reference to Maithili or Tirhutiya is in Amaduzzi's preface to Beligatti's ''Alphabetum Brammhanicum'', published in 1771.<ref name=\"Tourutiana\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Djfl_uZqLAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Tourutiana&f=false |last=Ded.

''Microcosmus'' offers one of the first attempts by a medieval [[Scolasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher to systematize history and knowledge into a comprehensive, rational structure. Godfrey used the symbolism of a biblical framework to treat the physical, psychological, and ethical aspects of man. He affirmed man's matter-spirit unity and the basic goodness of his nature, tempering this optimism with the realization that human nature has been weakened (\"fractured\") by sin, but not to an intrinsically corrupted and irreparable extent. In the ''Microcosmus'' Godfrey compared sensuality, imagination, reason and intelligence to the respective [[four classical elements]], earth, water, air and fire.\nGodfrey admits four principal capabilities in man: sensation, imagination, reason, and intelligence. Man's analytic reason and power of insight have the theoretical science of philosophy for their natural fulfillment. But a supernatural fulfillment, he maintains, consists in love. To this end divine intervention is needed to confer on man the perfective graces, or gifts, of enlightenment, affectivity, and perseverance.<ref>http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/micro/micro_238_5.html</ref>\n\n===''Fons philosophiae''===\nIn his other notable work, the ''Fons philosophiae'' (c. 1176; \"The Fount of Philosophy\"), Godfrey, in rhymed verse, proposed a classification of learning and considered the controversy between [[Philosophical realism|realists]] and [[nominalists]] (who held that ideas were only names, not real things) over the problem of universal concepts. Fons philosophiae is an allegorical account of the sources of Godfrey's intellectual formation (e.g., Plato, Aristotle, and Boethius), symbolized as a flowing stream from which he drew water as a student.\n\nAnother treatise, \"Anatomy of the Body of Christ,\" appended to ''Fons Philosophiae'', is a leading example of medieval Christian symbolism. A long poem ascribing to each member and organ of Christ's body some aspect of man's natural and supernatural purpose, it assembled texts from the early Church Fathers and helped form medieval devotion to the humanity of Christ. Godfrey's writings have won appreciation as a prime example of 12th-century [[humanism]] only through relatively recent scholarship, although their fundamental concepts of the positive values of man and nature were recognized to a limited extent by the high Scholasticism of the 13th century.\n\nThe ''Fons Philosophiae'' was a [[didactic]] poem presented to Abbot Stephen of St. Genevieve on the occasion of his appointment to the position at some point following 1173. It was originally one of three treatises, forming a unified corpus when combined with the  ''Anathomia Corporis Christi''  and the ''De Spirituale corpore Christi''.

The Strokes initially set out to record it with [[Gordon Raphael]], the producer of their first two albums. Later on, guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]] introduced them to [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer [[David Kahne]] ([[Paul McCartney]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]), who stepped in to collaborate with Raphael.

Impressions of Earth''''' is the third studio album by American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Strokes]]. It was released through [[RCA Records]] first on December 30, 2005, in Germany,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/The-Strokes/Alben/First-Impressions-Of-Earth-11120 |title=\"First Impressions of Earth\" von The Strokes |last=Butscher |first=Vicky |website=[[Laut.de]] |language=German |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> and January 3, 2006, elsewhere. Three singles were released from the album: \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\", \"[[Heart in a Cage]]\", and \"[[You Only Live Once (The Strokes song)|You Only Live Once]]\".\n\n==Recording==\nThe album was recorded over a ten-month period. The Strokes initially set out to record it with [[Gordon Raphael]], the producer of their first two albums. Later on, guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]] introduced them to [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer [[David Kahne]] ([[Paul McCartney]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]), who stepped in to collaborate with Raphael. However, the collaboration was not working out and so Raphael stepped down. As a result, the majority of the album was produced by Kahne.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 69/100<ref name=\"metacritic1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/first-impressions-of-earth/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for First Impressions Of Earth |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r812605|pure_url=yes}}|title=''First Impressions of Earth'' - The Strokes |author=Phares, Heather |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Hernandez |first=Raoul |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2006-01-13/323610/ |title=The Strokes: First Impressions of Earth (RCA) |newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=2006-01-13 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The A.V.
