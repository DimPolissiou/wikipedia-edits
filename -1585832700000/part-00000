There are 23 stands (all of them are self-maneuvering) of which 16 are remote, with 42 check-in desks and 16 boarding gates. Since its last enlargement in 1991 for the [[Seville Expo '92]], the airport has undergone minor extension works. 2013 saw the opening of a new car parking building with five floors. It is currently being remodeled to expand its capacity to ten million passengers a year, completion of the works by 2021.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nIn 1914, the first plane flying between the peninsula and [[Morocco]] landed at the improvised aerodrome of Tablada, which had been fitted out the previous year for an air festival. Following this, the municipal government of [[Seville]] handed over a plot of land measuring {{convert|240000|m2|abbr=on}} to the Military Aeronautical Society for the construction of an aerodrome. Work on the aerodrome began in 1915 and that same year it began to be used for training pilots and observers.\n\nIn 1919 the first commercial flights were operated between Seville and Madrid. The following year, an [[Airmail|air postal service]] was established between Seville and [[Larache]] and in 1921, the first Spanish commercial service between Seville and Larache was set up. In 1923, various facilities such as [[hangar]]s, workshops and premises were opened and approval was given for the construction of a municipal airport in Tablada at one end of the military aerodrome airfield, measuring {{convert|750|by|500|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn April 1927, Uni\u00f3n A\u00e9rea Espa\u00f1ola established the air service Madrid-Seville-Lisbon. In February 1929, the Seville airport project was approved and in March, the Tablada aerodrome was opened to flights and air traffic. It was decided that this service would cease once the planned airport was constructed.\n\nIn 1929 the first flight was operated between Madrid and Seville and in 1930, this was extended to the [[Canary Islands]]. In February 1931, the service between Berlin and Barcelona was extended to Seville. In December 1933, [[LAPE]] began a service between Seville and the Canary Islands.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish civil war]], Seville became the arrival point for African troops, whilst [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] served air transport with flights between [[Tetu\u00e1n]]-Seville-[[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], Seville-[[Salamanca]] and Seville-Larache-[[Las Palmas]].\n\nIn September 1945, works began on the Seville transoceanic airport, with the construction of runways 05/23, 02/20 and 09/27. One year later, it was classified as a customs point and runways 05/23 and 02/20 were asphalted. In 1948, a goniometer was installed, the runway lighting was completed, and the runways became known as 04/22, 18/36 and 09/27. In 1956, runway 09/27 was extended and runway 18/36 became a taxiway.\n\nIn 1957, works were carried out on the terminal building and the control tower. Seville Airport was then included in the Hispanic American Agreement for the installation of a supplies base. The facilities were developed near the threshold of 04, rendering the runway out of service.\n\nIn 1965 an Instrument Landing System was installed. Between 1971 and 1975, the terminal area was renovated, the apron was extended, a new terminal building was constructed and new access roads were developed.\n\nIn 1989, with a focus on the [[Seville Expo '92]], the apron was extended, and a new access from the national [[Carretera Nacional N-IV|motorway N-IV]] was opened; a new terminal building and a new control tower to the south of the runway were also built. On 31 July, the new installations were inaugurated.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe new terminal expansion program was begun in 2019 to cope with rapid passenger growth.\n\n==Airlines and

There are 23 stands (all of them are self-maneuvering) of which 16 are remote, with 42 check-in desks and 16 boarding gates. Since its last enlargement in 1991 for the [[Seville Expo '92]], the airport has undergone minor extension works. 2013 saw the opening of a new car parking building with five floors. It is currently being remodeled to expand its capacity to ten million passengers a year, completion of the works by 2021.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nIn 1914, the first plane flying between the peninsula and [[Morocco]] landed at the improvised aerodrome of Tablada, which had been fitted out the previous year for an air festival. Following this, the municipal government of [[Seville]] handed over a plot of land measuring {{convert|240000|m2|abbr=on}} to the Military Aeronautical Society for the construction of an aerodrome. Work on the aerodrome began in 1915 and that same year it began to be used for training pilots and observers.\n\nIn 1919 the first commercial flights were operated between Seville and Madrid. The following year, an [[Airmail|air postal service]] was established between Seville and [[Larache]] and in 1921, the first Spanish commercial service between Seville and Larache was set up. In 1923, various facilities such as [[hangar]]s, workshops and premises were opened and approval was given for the construction of a municipal airport in Tablada at one end of the military aerodrome airfield, measuring {{convert|750|by|500|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn April 1927, Uni\u00f3n A\u00e9rea Espa\u00f1ola established the air service Madrid-Seville-Lisbon. In February 1929, the Seville airport project was approved and in March, the Tablada aerodrome was opened to flights and air traffic. It was decided that this service would cease once the planned airport was constructed.\n\nIn 1929 the first flight was operated between Madrid and Seville and in 1930, this was extended to the [[Canary Islands]]. In February 1931, the service between Berlin and Barcelona was extended to Seville. In December 1933, [[LAPE]] began a service between Seville and the Canary Islands.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish civil war]], Seville became the arrival point for African troops, whilst [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] served air transport with flights between [[Tetu\u00e1n]]-Seville-[[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], Seville-[[Salamanca]] and Seville-Larache-[[Las Palmas]].\n\nIn September 1945, works began on the Seville transoceanic airport, with the construction of runways 05/23, 02/20 and 09/27. One year later, it was classified as a customs point and runways 05/23 and 02/20 were asphalted. In 1948, a goniometer was installed, the runway lighting was completed, and the runways became known as 04/22, 18/36 and 09/27. In 1956, runway 09/27 was extended and runway 18/36 became a taxiway.\n\nIn 1957, works were carried out on the terminal building and the control tower. Seville Airport was then included in the Hispanic American Agreement for the installation of a supplies base. The facilities were developed near the threshold of 04, rendering the runway out of service.\n\nIn 1965 an Instrument Landing System was installed. Between 1971 and 1975, the terminal area was renovated, the apron was extended, a new terminal building was constructed and new access roads were developed.\n\nIn 1989, with a focus on the [[Seville Expo '92]], the apron was extended, and a new access from the national [[Carretera Nacional N-IV|motorway N-IV]] was opened; a new terminal building and a new control tower to the south of the runway were also built. On 31 July, the new installations were inaugurated.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe new terminal expansion program was begun in 2019 to cope with rapid passenger growth.\n\n==Airlines and

They constituted the Northern part of the [[Burgundian State]]. The area comprised the major parts of present-day [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Hauts-de-France]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries}}\nA fair share (but not most) of these territories were inherited by the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] dukes, a younger branch of the French royal [[House of Valois]] in 1384, upon the death of Count [[Louis II, Count of Flanders|Louis II of Flanders]]. His heiress, [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders|Margaret III of Flanders]] in 1369 had married [[Philip the Bold]], youngest son of King [[John II of France]] and the first of the Valois dukes of Burgundy at [[Dijon]], who thus inherited the [[County of Flanders]]. The Flemish comital [[House of Dampierre]] had been French vassals, who held territory around the affluent cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], but also adjacent lands in former [[Lower Lorraine]] east of the [[Scheldt]] river (\"Imperial Flanders\") including the exclave of [[Lordship of Mechelen|Mechelen]], which were a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, and furthermore the neighbouring French [[County of Artois]]. Together they initiated an era of Burgundian governance in the Low Countries.\n\nThe Dampierre legacy further comprised the French counties of [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]] in northern [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[County of Nevers|Nevers]] west of Burgundy proper, both held by Philip's younger son [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Philip II]] from 1407, as well as the [[County of Burgundy]] (''Franche-Comt\u00e9'') east of it, an Imperial fief which had been part of the former [[Kingdom of Arles]].\n\nIn the following decades, the Burgundian dukes expanded their territories in the Low Countries by the acquisition of several [[Imperial State]]s: Duke [[Philip the Good]] purchased the [[County of Namur]] in 1421, inherited the Duchies of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] in 1430, and seized the Counties of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]] in 1432, and the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] in 1441. His son, the last Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]], in 1473 annexed the Duchy of [[Guelders]], which had been pawned by late [[Arnold, Duke of Guelders|Arnold of Egmond]].\n\nThe Valois era would last until 1477, when Duke Charles the Bold died at the [[Battle of Nancy]] leaving no male heir. The territorial Duchy of Burgundy reverted to the French crown according to [[Salic law]], and King [[Louis XI of France]] also seized the French portion of the Burgundian possessions in the Low Countries. The Imperial fiefs passed to the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] House of Habsburg through Charles' daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] and her husband Archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]], son of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]. Maximilian however regarded the Burgundian Netherlands including Flanders and Artois as the undivided domains of his wife and himself and marched against the French. The conflict culminated at the [[Battle of Guinegate (1479)|Battle of Guinegate]] in 1479. Though Maximilian was victorious, he was only able to gain the County of Flanders according to the 1482 [[Treaty of Arras (1482)|Treaty of Arras]] after his wife Mary had suddenly died, while France retained Artois.\n\nIn her testament, Mary of Burgundy had bequested the Burgundian heritage to her and Maximilian's son, [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]]. His father, dissatisfied with the terms of the Arras agreement, continued to contest the seized French territories. In 1493, King [[Charles VIII of France]] according to the [[Treaty of Senlis]] finally renounced Artois, which together with Flanders was incorporated into the Imperial [[Seventeen Provinces]] under the rule of Philip.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe population of the main provinces of the Low Countries in 1477.<ref>\tVan Houtte (J. \u0391.).

Attempts at enlarging personal control by the dukes resulted in revolts among the independent towns (sometimes supported by independent local nobles) and bloody military suppression in response. An increasingly modernized central government, with a bureaucracy of clerks, allowed the dukes to become celebrated art patrons and establish a glamorous court life that gave rise to conventions of behavior that lasted for centuries. Philip the Good (1419\u20131467) extended his personal control to the southeast; bringing Brussels, Namur, and Li\u00e8ge under his control. He channeled the traditional independence of the cities through such mechanisms as the first [[States-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], and consolidating of the region's economy.\n\nThe [[Estates General of 1464|first Estates General]] of the Burgundian territories met in the City Hall of [[Bruges]] on 9 January 1464. It included delegates from the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the [[County of Flanders]], [[Walloon Flanders|Lille, Douai and Orchies]], the [[County of Artois]], the [[County of Hainaut]], the [[County of Holland]], the [[County of Zeeland]], the [[County of Namur]], the [[Lordship of Mechelen]], and the [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]].<ref>[[Wim Blockmans]], \"De samenstelling van de staten van de Bourgondische landsheerlijkheden omstreeks 1464\", ''Standen en Landen'' 47 (1968), pp. 57-112.</ref> Up to 1464, the Duke only maintained ties with each of the provincial States separately. In principle, the provincial Estates were composed of representatives of the three traditional [[Estates of the realm|estates]]: [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and the Third Estate, but the exact composition and influence of each estate (within the provincial Estates) could differ. Convening an Estates General in which all provincial Estates were represented was part of [[Philip the Good]]'s policy of [[centralisation]].\n\n==Ducal patronage==\nFrom 1441, Philip based his ducal court in Brussels, but [[Bruges]] was the world center of commerce, though by the 1480s the inevitable silting of its harbor was bringing its economic hegemony to a close. Philip was a great patron of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and court painting reached new highs:  [[Robert Campin]], the famous [[Van Eyck]] brothers, and [[Rogier Van der Weyden]]\n\n==Social and economic==\nIn 1491 and 1492, the peasants revolted in some areas.

They constituted the Northern part of the [[Burgundian State]]. The area comprised the major parts of present-day [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Hauts-de-France]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries}}\nA fair share (but not most) of these territories were inherited by the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] dukes, a younger branch of the French royal [[House of Valois]] in 1384, upon the death of Count [[Louis II, Count of Flanders|Louis II of Flanders]]. His heiress, [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders|Margaret III of Flanders]] in 1369 had married [[Philip the Bold]], youngest son of King [[John II of France]] and the first of the Valois dukes of Burgundy at [[Dijon]], who thus inherited the [[County of Flanders]]. The Flemish comital [[House of Dampierre]] had been French vassals, who held territory around the affluent cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], but also adjacent lands in former [[Lower Lorraine]] east of the [[Scheldt]] river (\"Imperial Flanders\") including the exclave of [[Lordship of Mechelen|Mechelen]], which were a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, and furthermore the neighbouring French [[County of Artois]]. Together they initiated an era of Burgundian governance in the Low Countries.\n\nThe Dampierre legacy further comprised the French counties of [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]] in northern [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[County of Nevers|Nevers]] west of Burgundy proper, both held by Philip's younger son [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Philip II]] from 1407, as well as the [[County of Burgundy]] (''Franche-Comt\u00e9'') east of it, an Imperial fief which had been part of the former [[Kingdom of Arles]].\n\nIn the following decades, the Burgundian dukes expanded their territories in the Low Countries by the acquisition of several [[Imperial State]]s: Duke [[Philip the Good]] purchased the [[County of Namur]] in 1421, inherited the Duchies of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] in 1430, and seized the Counties of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]] in 1432, and the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] in 1441. His son, the last Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]], in 1473 annexed the Duchy of [[Guelders]], which had been pawned by late [[Arnold, Duke of Guelders|Arnold of Egmond]].\n\nThe Valois era would last until 1477, when Duke Charles the Bold died at the [[Battle of Nancy]] leaving no male heir. The territorial Duchy of Burgundy reverted to the French crown according to [[Salic law]], and King [[Louis XI of France]] also seized the French portion of the Burgundian possessions in the Low Countries. The Imperial fiefs passed to the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] House of Habsburg through Charles' daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] and her husband Archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]], son of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]. Maximilian however regarded the Burgundian Netherlands including Flanders and Artois as the undivided domains of his wife and himself and marched against the French. The conflict culminated at the [[Battle of Guinegate (1479)|Battle of Guinegate]] in 1479. Though Maximilian was victorious, he was only able to gain the County of Flanders according to the 1482 [[Treaty of Arras (1482)|Treaty of Arras]] after his wife Mary had suddenly died, while France retained Artois.\n\nIn her testament, Mary of Burgundy had bequested the Burgundian heritage to her and Maximilian's son, [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]]. His father, dissatisfied with the terms of the Arras agreement, continued to contest the seized French territories. In 1493, King [[Charles VIII of France]] according to the [[Treaty of Senlis]] finally renounced Artois, which together with Flanders was incorporated into the Imperial [[Seventeen Provinces]] under the rule of Philip.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe population of the main provinces of the Low Countries in 1477.<ref>\tVan Houtte (J. \u0391.).

Attempts at enlarging personal control by the dukes resulted in revolts among the independent towns (sometimes supported by independent local nobles) and bloody military suppression in response. An increasingly modernized central government, with a bureaucracy of clerks, allowed the dukes to become celebrated art patrons and establish a glamorous court life that gave rise to conventions of behavior that lasted for centuries. Philip the Good (1419\u20131467) extended his personal control to the southeast; bringing Brussels, Namur, and Li\u00e8ge under his control. He channeled the traditional independence of the cities through such mechanisms as the first [[States-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], and consolidating of the region's economy.\n\nThe [[Estates General of 1464|first Estates General]] of the Burgundian territories met in the City Hall of [[Bruges]] on 9 January 1464. It included delegates from the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the [[County of Flanders]], [[Walloon Flanders|Lille, Douai and Orchies]], the [[County of Artois]], the [[County of Hainaut]], the [[County of Holland]], the [[County of Zeeland]], the [[County of Namur]], the [[Lordship of Mechelen]], and the [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]].<ref>[[Wim Blockmans]], \"De samenstelling van de staten van de Bourgondische landsheerlijkheden omstreeks 1464\", ''Standen en Landen'' 47 (1968), pp. 57-112.</ref> Up to 1464, the Duke only maintained ties with each of the provincial States separately. In principle, the provincial Estates were composed of representatives of the three traditional [[Estates of the realm|estates]]: [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and the Third Estate, but the exact composition and influence of each estate (within the provincial Estates) could differ. Convening an Estates General in which all provincial Estates were represented was part of [[Philip the Good]]'s policy of [[centralisation]].\n\n==Ducal patronage==\nFrom 1441, Philip based his ducal court in Brussels, but [[Bruges]] was the world center of commerce, though by the 1480s the inevitable silting of its harbor was bringing its economic hegemony to a close. Philip was a great patron of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and court painting reached new highs:  [[Robert Campin]], the famous [[Van Eyck]] brothers, and [[Rogier Van der Weyden]]\n\n==Social and economic==\nIn 1491 and 1492, the peasants revolted in some areas. They were suppressed by Maximilian's forces under the command of Duke Albert of Saxony at a battle at  [[Heemskerk]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Henk van Nierop|author-link=Henk van Nierop|title=Treason in the Northern Quarter: War, Terror, and the Rule of Law in the Dutch Revolt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEHiZejOzikC&pg=PA25|year=2009|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=25}}</ref>\n\n==\"Burgundian character\"==\n\nIn the present-day [[Netherlands]], inhabitants of the [[cultural Christian|culturally Catholic]] area of [[Meierij van 's-Hertogenbosch]] are  considered by the other Dutch to have ''a Burgundian character'', meaning that they are supposed to be companionable people who like to party exuberantly.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |authorlink=Erwin Panofsky |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |title=Early Netherlandish Painting: Its Origins and Character |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1947 |isbn= }}\n*{{cite book |last=Prevenier |first=W. |last2=Blockmans |first2=W. |title=The Burgundian Netherlands |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |isbn=0-521-30611-6 }}\n*Stein, Robert. 2017.

Nabisco became part of the snack-food business, which took the name [[Mondel\u0113z International]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=129070&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1593014 |title=News Releases |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Alexandra_Hotel,_Boston,_MA,_1899.jpg|thumb|left|National Biscuit Company (and now defunct Quincy Biscuit) wagon advertising \"Uneeda Biscuit\" in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1899.]]\nNabisco dates its founding to 1898,<ref name=\"NewJerseycyclopedia\">Laurie, Maxine N.; and Mappen, Marc; ''Encyclopedia of New Jersey'': Rutgers University Press; 2004/2005. P. 555.</ref> a decade when the [[bakery]] business underwent a major consolidation.  Early in the decade, bakeries throughout the country were consolidated regionally, into companies such as Chicago's American Biscuit and Manufacturing Company (which was formed from 40 Midwestern bakeries in 1830), the New York Biscuit Company (consisting of seven eastern bakeries), and the United States Baking Company. In 1898, the National Biscuit Company was formed from the combination of those three. The merger resulted in a company with 114 bakeries across the US and headquartered in New York City. The word \"[[biscuit#British English meaning|biscuit]]\" is a traditional term for what are now termed \"cookies\" and \"crackers\" in [[American English]], though [[British English]] retains \"biscuit\" to refer to these baked goods.\n\nKey to the founding of Nabisco was Pittsburgh baking mogul Sylvester S. Marvin. Marvin arrived in Pittsburgh in 1863 and established himself in the cracker business, founding S. S. Marvin Co. Its products included crackers, cakes, and breads.  Marvin was called the Edison of manufacturing for his innovations in the bakery business. By 1888, it was the largest in the US, and the centerpiece of the National Biscuit Company.  Marvin was also a member of the elite [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]] of [[Johnstown Flood]] fame. The [[F. A. Kennedy Steam Bakery]] in [[Boston]], known for inventing [[Fig Newtons]] was one of the very first acquisitions made by Nabisco, joining the company in 1898. Also vital to the founding of Nabisco were John and Emily Malloy. The couple started a bakery in a subway in Chicago and created the Lorna Doone. Upon the bakery\u2019s closing, the recipe was purchased. <ref name=\"Cambridge Historical Society\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgehistory.org/discover/candy/nabisco.html|title=Cambridge History|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111051756/http://www.cambridgehistory.org/discover/candy/nabisco.html|archivedate=2015-01-11}}</ref> [[File:Dbq ghost 4.jpg|thumb|Early 20th-century Uneeda Biscuit [[ghost sign]], [[Dubuque, Iowa]]]]\n\n===Packaging breakthrough===\nAfter the consolidation, the president of Nabisco, Adolphus Green, asked Frank Peters to create a package to distribute fresher products. This paved its way for In-Er Seal package, whose logo is a prototype for the \"Nabisco Thing\", an animated character created in 1995 to sell its products to kids. The In-Er Seal package is a system of inter-folded [[wax paper]] and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] to \"seal in the freshness\" of the product. At the beginning of his presidency, Green decided the National Biscuit Company, often shortened to NBC, needed a new idea that grabbed the public's attention. He got it when his employees created a new cracker that was flakier and lighter than any of their competitors' versions.\n\nA son of [[Robert Gair]], the package manufacturer, said, \"You need a name,\" and from this sentence came the name ''Uneeda''.<ref>David Traxel (1998), ''1898:  The Birth of the American Century'', New York:  Knopf, Ch. 13, \"The New American Way\", pp. 291\u2013292, {{ISBN|0-679-45467-5}} .</ref>  The Uneeda biscuit looked promising, but Green had to make sure it got to customers fresh, so it was the first to use the In-Er Seal package in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nabisco, Inc.|url=http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/nabisco/98790/|website=AdAge|accessdate=29 June 2017|date=2015-05-27}}</ref> Until then, crackers were sold unbranded and packed loosely in [[Barrel|barrels]]. Mothers would give their sons a [[paper bag]] and ask them to run to the store and get the bag filled with crackers. National Biscuit Company used this as part of Uneeda Biscuit advertising symbol, which depicts a boy carrying a pack of Uneeda Biscuit in the rain. In 2009 (after over 110 years), Nabisco discontinued the Uneeda biscuit, concerned that the product was not sufficiently profitable.\n\n===20th century===\nThe first use of \"Nabisco\" was in a cracker brand first produced by National Biscuit Company in 1901.<ref name=\"History of Nabisco\">{{cite web|last1=Bellis|first1=Mary|title=History of Nabisco|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/foodrelatedinventions/a/Nabisco.htm|publisher=About Money|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref> The firm later introduced\u2014either through development or acquisition\u2014 [[Fig Newtons]], Nabisco Wafers (early 1900s, later sold in one form as Biscos, a sugar wafer originally containing a variety of flavored fillings), Anola Wafers (early 1900s, later discontinued; a chocolate wafer with chocolate filling), Barnum's [[Animal cracker|Animal Crackers]] (1902), Cameos (1910), [[Lorna Doone (cookie)|Lorna Doones]] (1912; shortbread), [[Oreo]]s (1912),<ref name=\"NewJerseycyclopedia\"/> and Famous Chocolate Wafers (1924; a thin wafer without filling).\n\nIn 1924, the National Biscuit Company introduced a snack in a sealed packet called the Peanut Sandwich Packet. They soon added a second, the Sorbetto Sandwich Packet. These allowed salesmen to sell to [[Soda fountain|soda fountains]], road stands, [[Milk bar|milk bars]], [[Lunch room|lunch rooms]], and [[news stands]]. Sales increased, and in 1928, the company started to use the name NAB. The term Nabs today is used to generically mean any type of snack crackers, most commonly in the southern US.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duffin-Ward|first1=Maureen|last2=Hallgren|first2=Gary|title=Suddenly Southern: A Yankee's Guide to Living in Dixie|date=2004|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9780743254953|page=44}}</ref>\n\nDuring WWII, the company manufactured [[K-ration]]s for US troops. The first use of the red triangular logo was in 1952.

It also acquired F.H. Bennett Company, maker of [[Milk-Bone]] dog biscuits, in 1931. When [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] bought Nabisco, it included Christie.\n\nIn 1981, Nabisco merged with [[Standard Brands]], maker of [[Planters]] Nuts, [[Baby Ruth]] and [[Butterfinger]] candy bars, Royal gelatin, Fleischmann's and Blue Bonnet margarines, amongst others. The company was then renamed Nabisco Brands, Inc. At that time, it also acquired the [[Life Savers]] brand from the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|E.R.

In 1889, [[William Henry \"Judge\" Moore|William Moore]] acquired Pearson & Sons Bakery, Josiah Bent Bakery, and six other bakeries to start the New York Biscuit Company.\n\n[[Adolphus Green]] (1843\u20131917)<ref>{{cite journal|title=Green, Adolphus Williamson|journal=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography|year=1916|pages=291\u2013292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_ApAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA291}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Uneeda Read This|author=Weinberg, Carl|date=January 2010|website=The Organization of American Historians Magazine of History|url=http://magazine.oah.org/issues/241/weinberg.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823095010/http://magazine.oah.org/issues/241/weinberg.html|archivedate=2015-08-23}}</ref> started the American Biscuit and Manufacturing Company in 1890 after acquiring 40 different bakeries. William Moore, Adolphus Green, and John G. Zeller (Richmond Steam Bakery) merged in 1898 to form the National Biscuit Company. Adolphus Green was named president.\n\nThe name ''Nabisco'' was first used as part of a name for a sugar [[wafer]] in 1901. John G. Zeller was president of National Biscuit Company from 1923\u20131931. Nabisco celebrated its golden anniversary in 1948. By 1971, ''Nabisco'' had become the corporate name. In 1981, Nabisco merged with [[Standard Brands]] to form '''Nabisco Brands''', which in 1985 merged with [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] to form [[RJR Nabisco]].\n\nKraft General Foods acquired the Nabisco ready-to-eat [[Cold cereal|cold cereals]] from RJR Nabisco in 1993 (the cereal brands are now owned by [[Post Holdings]]). In 1999, Nabisco acquired [[Farley's & Sathers Candy Company|Favorite Brands International]].\n\nIn 2000, [[Philip Morris Companies Inc.]] acquired Nabisco and merged it with [[Kraft Foods]] in one of the largest mergers in the food industry. In 2011, Kraft Foods announced it was splitting into a grocery company and a snack food company. Nabisco became part of the snack-food business, which took the name [[Mondel\u0113z International]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=129070&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1593014 |title=News Releases |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Alexandra_Hotel,_Boston,_MA,_1899.jpg|thumb|left|National Biscuit Company (and now defunct Quincy Biscuit) wagon advertising \"Uneeda Biscuit\" in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1899.]]\nNabisco dates its founding to 1898,<ref name=\"NewJerseycyclopedia\">Laurie, Maxine N.; and Mappen, Marc; ''Encyclopedia of New Jersey'': Rutgers University Press; 2004/2005. P. 555.</ref> a decade when the [[bakery]] business underwent a major consolidation.  Early in the decade, bakeries throughout the country were consolidated regionally, into companies such as Chicago's American Biscuit and Manufacturing Company (which was formed from 40 Midwestern bakeries in 1830), the New York Biscuit Company (consisting of seven eastern bakeries), and the United States Baking Company. In 1898, the National Biscuit Company was formed from the combination of those three. The merger resulted in a company with 114 bakeries across the US and headquartered in New York City. The word \"[[biscuit#British English meaning|biscuit]]\" is a traditional term for what are now termed \"cookies\" and \"crackers\" in [[American English]], though [[British English]] retains \"biscuit\" to refer to these baked goods.\n\nKey to the founding of Nabisco was Pittsburgh baking mogul Sylvester S. Marvin. Marvin arrived in Pittsburgh in 1863 and established himself in the cracker business, founding S. S. Marvin Co. Its products included crackers, cakes, and breads.  Marvin was called the Edison of manufacturing for his innovations in the bakery business. By 1888, it was the largest in the US, and the centerpiece of the National Biscuit Company.  Marvin was also a member of the elite [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]] of [[Johnstown Flood]] fame. The [[F. A. Kennedy Steam Bakery]] in [[Boston]], known for inventing [[Fig Newtons]] was one of the very first acquisitions made by Nabisco, joining the company in 1898. Also vital to the founding of Nabisco were John and Emily Malloy. The couple started a bakery in a subway in Chicago and created the Lorna Doone. Upon the bakery\u2019s closing, the recipe was purchased. <ref name=\"Cambridge Historical Society\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgehistory.org/discover/candy/nabisco.html|title=Cambridge History|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111051756/http://www.cambridgehistory.org/discover/candy/nabisco.html|archivedate=2015-01-11}}</ref> [[File:Dbq ghost 4.jpg|thumb|Early 20th-century Uneeda Biscuit [[ghost sign]], [[Dubuque, Iowa]]]]\n\n===Packaging breakthrough===\nAfter the consolidation, the president of Nabisco, Adolphus Green, asked Frank Peters to create a package to distribute fresher products. This paved its way for In-Er Seal package, whose logo is a prototype for the \"Nabisco Thing\", an animated character created in 1995 to sell its products to kids. The In-Er Seal package is a system of inter-folded [[wax paper]] and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] to \"seal in the freshness\" of the product. At the beginning of his presidency, Green decided the National Biscuit Company, often shortened to NBC, needed a new idea that grabbed the public's attention. He got it when his employees created a new cracker that was flakier and lighter than any of their competitors' versions.\n\nA son of [[Robert Gair]], the package manufacturer, said, \"You need a name,\" and from this sentence came the name ''Uneeda''.<ref>David Traxel (1998), ''1898:  The Birth of the American Century'', New York:  Knopf, Ch. 13, \"The New American Way\", pp. 291\u2013292, {{ISBN|0-679-45467-5}} .</ref>  The Uneeda biscuit looked promising, but Green had to make sure it got to customers fresh, so it was the first to use the In-Er Seal package in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nabisco, Inc.|url=http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/nabisco/98790/|website=AdAge|accessdate=29 June 2017|date=2015-05-27}}</ref> Until then, crackers were sold unbranded and packed loosely in [[Barrel|barrels]]. Mothers would give their sons a [[paper bag]] and ask them to run to the store and get the bag filled with crackers. National Biscuit Company used this as part of Uneeda Biscuit advertising symbol, which depicts a boy carrying a pack of Uneeda Biscuit in the rain. In 2009 (after over 110 years), Nabisco discontinued the Uneeda biscuit, concerned that the product was not sufficiently profitable.\n\n===20th century===\nThe first use of \"Nabisco\" was in a cracker brand first produced by National Biscuit Company in 1901.<ref name=\"History of Nabisco\">{{cite web|last1=Bellis|first1=Mary|title=History of Nabisco|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/foodrelatedinventions/a/Nabisco.htm|publisher=About Money|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref> The firm later introduced\u2014either through development or acquisition\u2014 [[Fig Newtons]], Nabisco Wafers (early 1900s, later sold in one form as Biscos, a sugar wafer originally containing a variety of flavored fillings), Anola Wafers (early 1900s, later discontinued; a chocolate wafer with chocolate filling), Barnum's [[Animal cracker|Animal Crackers]] (1902), Cameos (1910), [[Lorna Doone (cookie)|Lorna Doones]] (1912; shortbread), [[Oreo]]s (1912),<ref name=\"NewJerseycyclopedia\"/> and Famous Chocolate Wafers (1924; a thin wafer without filling).\n\nIn 1924, the National Biscuit Company introduced a snack in a sealed packet called the Peanut Sandwich Packet. They soon added a second, the Sorbetto Sandwich Packet. These allowed salesmen to sell to [[Soda fountain|soda fountains]], road stands, [[Milk bar|milk bars]], [[Lunch room|lunch rooms]], and [[news stands]]. Sales increased, and in 1928, the company started to use the name NAB. The term Nabs today is used to generically mean any type of snack crackers, most commonly in the southern US.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duffin-Ward|first1=Maureen|last2=Hallgren|first2=Gary|title=Suddenly Southern: A Yankee's Guide to Living in Dixie|date=2004|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9780743254953|page=44}}</ref>\n\nDuring WWII, the company manufactured [[K-ration]]s for US troops.

To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a [[Monocoque|unibody]] aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom [[image sensor]] and the ability to automatically generate [[Montage (filmmaking)|montages]] of media, an updated version of HTC's [[HTC Sense|Sense user experience]], BlinkFeed\u2014an [[news aggregator|aggregator]] of news and social network content, and an [[electronic program guide]] app with the ability to serve as a [[universal remote]] via an [[infrared blaster|IR blaster]] located in the device's power button.\n\nBeginning in March 2013, the HTC One was made available to mobile operators and major retailers in at least 181 countries. Manufacturing delays led to a staggered release beginning in late March, with its release date in certain markets (such as Asia and North America) pushed to late-April. Nevertheless, with around 5 million units being sold during its first two months of worldwide availability, HTC stated that the One was the most successful launch in the company's history.<ref name=atd-onemini/><ref name=tr-onesales/>\n\nThe HTC One was praised for the quality of its [[industrial design]], high-density 468 [[pixel density|ppi]] display, and high-power 2.6[[audio power|W RMS]] stereo sound system, and was well-received for its overall performance and improved [[user experience]] in comparison to earlier HTC devices. However, some aspects of the device, such as its photo quality, battery life, and certain elements of the device's operating system, were subject to scrutiny by critics. The device has received numerous awards and accolades, including being named \"Best New Mobile Device\" by the [[GSM Association]] at [[Mobile World Congress]] 2013, and was named the best smartphone of 2013 at the same conference one year later.

The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap [[injection molding]]. The polycarbonate forms a band around the edge of the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a [[loop antenna]] for the One's [[near field communication]] (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision [[Numerical control|CNC cutting]] to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.\n\nTwo capacitive navigation keys, \"Back\" and \"Home\", are located below the display, flanked by HTC's logo in the center. While other recent HTC devices (such as the [[HTC One X|One X]]) used a three-key layout with \"Back\", \"Home\", and \"Recent apps\" keys, HTC designers believed that using only two navigation keys as opposed to three would reduce user confusion. As with other HTC devices lacking a hardware \"Menu\" key (as per revised Android [[human interface guidelines]] introduced in 2012, which [[deprecation|deprecate]] their use), apps that have not been updated to reflect the newer guidelines display a \"Menu\" button on a black bar on the bottom of the screen.<ref name=\"engadget-design\">{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-hands-on-design-and-hardware/ | title=HTC One hands-on: design and hardware | last=Joire | first=Myriam | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822214309/http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-hands-on-design-and-hardware/ | archivedate=22 August 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=anandtech-review/>\n\n=== Hardware ===\n\nThe HTC One uses a 4.7 inch, [[1080p]] [[Super LCD]] 3 touchscreen display with a [[pixel density]] of 468 ppi.<ref name=\"pcmag-handson\">{{cite web | last=Colon | first=Alex | last2=Segan|first2= Sascha | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2415574,00.asp | title=Hands On With the HTC One | publisher=Ziff Davis | work=PC Magazine | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511135338/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2415574,00.asp | archivedate=11 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> The backside of the device houses the camera, the LED flash, and the secondary microphone.

Most high-end smartphones at the time of its release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0&nbsp;\u00b5m, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One's UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of [[dynamic range]] and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments.<ref name=anandtech-review/><ref name=\"cnet-4mp\">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569991-94/htc-explains-why-4-megapixels-are-better-than-8 | title=HTC explains why 4 megapixels are better than 8 | last=Westaway | first=Luke | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=CNET | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511023707/http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569991-94/htc-explains-why-4-megapixels-are-better-than-8/| archivedate=11 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> The camera also includes [[optical image stabilization]], and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 [[image processor]].<ref name=\"verge-unveiled\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/19/4003728/htc-one-launch-announcement | title=HTC One announced: a 4.7-inch, 1080p Android flagship with an 'UltraPixel' camera | last=Savov | first=Vlad | publisher=Vox Media | work=The Verge | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521204139/http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/19/4003728/htc-one-launch-announcement |archivedate=21 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=engadget-zoe/>\n\nIn September 2013, HTC confirmed \"isolated reports\" of users experiencing a purple or red tint with the camera in low-light conditions.

Four shortcuts to frequently used applications can be stored on a dock at the bottom of the screen; the button in the center of the dock opens the application drawer, which displays a menu containing all of the applications installed on the device. A notifications tray accessible by pulling from the top of the screen allows users to view notifications received from other apps, as well as enable the One's \"Power Saver\" mode.\n\nPre-loaded applications on the HTC One provide access to [[Google applications|Google's various services]], including [[Google Play]], which can be used to download and purchase apps, music, movies, and e-books. Other pre-installed apps on the HTC One include a browser with [[Adobe Flash]] support, Calendar, Contacts, [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Facebook]], FM Radio, [[Google Chrome for Android]], Kid Mode, Music, Notes, [[Polaris Office]], [[SoundHound]], Tasks, [[TuneIn]] Radio, and Weather (data provided by [[AccuWeather]]).<ref name=anandtech-review/> The recent apps menu, which displays nine recently opened apps on a grid of thumbnails, is accessed by double-tapping the Home key, while [[Google Search]] is accessed by long-pressing the key. As with previous devices in its series, and adhering to its official [[deprecation]] in [[Android Honeycomb|Android 3.0]], the HTC One does not include a \"Menu\" button. By default, apps which are not specifically built for Android 3.0 or later display a virtual menu key on a black bar at the bottom of the screen; this black bar is removable in Android 4.2.2 and later if users choose to enable the \"Menu\" key functionality by long-pressing the \"Home\" key.<ref name=\"anandtech-one422update\"/>\n\nThe HTC One shipped with [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.1.2 \"Jelly Bean\"]] and version 5.0 of HTC's proprietary [[HTC Sense|Sense]] software suite. In comparison to previous versions of the software, Sense 5 uses a flat, minimalist visual style with refreshed icons and the condensed variant of the [[Roboto]] font family. Instead of a traditional home screen display with apps and widgets, Sense 5 defaults to a screen known as BlinkFeed, a [[news aggregator]] which displays a scrolling grid of news headlines from selected sources (as syndicated by Mobiles Republic) and [[social networking service|social network]] content in a similar fashion to [[Flipboard]] and [[Windows Phone]]\u2019s live tiles. New content is synchronized every two hours when connected to a mobile network, but more frequently while on Wi-Fi.<ref name=anandtech-review/><ref name=engadget-handsonui/> Directly above the BlinkFeed display is a clock which displays the user\u2019s local time and weather forecast; the signature [[flip clock]] widget seen on previous HTC devices was replaced by a simpler digital clock for Sense 5. Hundreds of different clock designs by HTC\u2019s designers, narrowed down to 25, were considered before the final design was chosen. As with previous versions of Sense, users can still add or remove pages on the home screen for housing app shortcuts and widgets; one such page is provided by default, and which page to display by default can be set by the user. However, BlinkFeed will always occupy the leftmost page of the home screen.<ref name=\"cnet-sensereboot\">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569700-94/htc-one-reboots-sense-and-hopes-for-a-comeback/ | title=HTC One reboots Sense and hopes for a comeback | last=Cheng | first=Roger | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=CNET | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304182100/http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569700-94/htc-one-reboots-sense-and-hopes-for-a-comeback/ | archivedate=4 March 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-handsonui\">{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-software-hands-on-sense-5-blinkfeed-sense-tv-and-new/ | title=HTC One software hands-on: Sense 5, BlinkFeed, Sense TV and new Sync Manager | last=Lai | first=Richard | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304144949/http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-software-hands-on-sense-5-blinkfeed-sense-tv-and-new/ | archivedate=4 March 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> The application drawer uses a 3x4 grid to display application shortcuts by default, but can still be changed back to the denser 4x5 grid used by past versions.

The upgrade also added the ability to show the current battery percentage on the status bar, more consistent behavior for the home key, allows the removal of icons from the home screen's dock, allows the Home key to serve as the deprecated \"Menu\" key in certain apps by long-pressing (in lieu of displaying it on a black bar on-screen), allows [[Google Now]] to be accessed by swiping up from the home button, and adds support for displaying widgets on the lock screen (however, unlike stock Android, only one widget can be placed on the lock screen at a time).<ref name=\"anandtech-one422update\">{{cite web | url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7128/android-422-update-for-htc-one-rollout-begins-we-take-a-look | title=Android 4.2.2 Update Rollout for HTC One Begins - We Take a Look | last=Klug | first=Brian | publisher=Anandtech Inc. | work=Anandtech | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912185153/http://www.anandtech.com/show/7128/android-422-update-for-htc-one-rollout-begins-we-take-a-look |archivedate=12 September 2013 | url-status=live | date=8 July 2013 | accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-htcone422\">{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/01/htc-one-android-4-2-2-update/ | title=HTC One Android 4.2.2 update adds UI features, sticks with Sense 5.0 | last=Trew | first=James | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812165927/http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/01/htc-one-android-4-2-2-update/ | archivedate=12 August 2013 |url-status=live | date=1 June 2013 | accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn North America, Android 4.2.2 was only available as the pre-loaded software on Verizon Wireless' HTC One, since HTC considered 4.2 to be relatively minor on smartphones.

Epstein cited differences in hardware construction and industrial design, as well as various features of Sense 5.0; one example included the higher-quality IR blaster and TV app on the One compared to the S4.<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Zach|title=Galaxy S4 vs. HTC One: Four months later, which is the best Android phone in the world?|url=http://bgr.com/2013/08/13/galaxy-s4-vs-htc-one-review-best-android-phone/|work=Boy Genius Report|publisher=BGR Media|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=13 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]''' technology columnist [[David Pogue]] praised the attention to detail in its design, along with its performance, camera, and display quality; and considered it to be \"the most beautiful [Android phone] you\u2019ve ever seen\". However, Pogue criticized HTC's continuing usage on the Sense user interface, the arrangement of its physical navigation keys, the inability for users to expand its storage or replace its battery, and its \"typical [one day] 4G LTE Android\" battery life. In conclusion, Pogue stated that \"you could quibble with the software overlays, but it would be hard to imagine a more impressive piece of phone hardware.\"<ref name=\"nyt-poguehtcone\">{{cite web | url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/the-htc-one-deserves-its-place-in-the-spotlight/ | title=The HTC One Deserves Its Place in the Spotlight | last=Pogue | first=David | publisher=The New York Times | work=Pogue's Posts | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425060954/http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/the-htc-one-deserves-its-place-in-the-spotlight/ | archivedate=25 April 2013 | url-status=live | date=10 April 2013 | accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Verge]]'' gave the HTC One an 8.3 out of 10; aside from the positioning of its power button and navigation keys, which were considered to be hard to reach, its hardware design was praised for having a \"totally unique and somehow still understated\" look, while its 1080p display was considered to be one of the sharpest displays on a smartphone\u2014although not bright enough to be seen properly in direct sunlight. In combination with its stereo speakers, the One was considered a good phone for viewing videos and playing games, while its call quality was judged as being sufficient. In regards to performance, the HTC One was considered to be \"an impressively powerful phone across the board\" due to its high scores on various [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark tests]]. Its camera received mixed reviews; while it had better low-light performance than its competitors as advertised, the One's photos were criticized for looking \"soft and mushy\" due to extensive post-processing and only looked relatively good at the smaller sizes applied by services such as [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]]. The Zoe features were considered unique and useful, but the HTC Share service was panned for being \"kind of like [[Vine (software)|Vine]], except [that] your clips only last a few months and no one\u2019s ever going to use it.\" The One was also criticized for its \"decidedly average\" battery life, and for some of the \"unintuitive\" design changes that HTC made to the Android UI.<ref name=\"verge-onereview\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4086390/htc-one-review | title=HTC One review | last=Pierce | first=David | publisher=Vox Media | work=The Verge | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817041424/http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4086390/htc-one-review |archivedate=17 August 2013 | url-status=live | date=11 March 2013 | accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''\u2019s Michael Calore praised the HTC One\u2019s \"truly gorgeous\" and \"seamless\" design, and considered the quality of its internal speakers to be the best of any smartphone thus far. The display was considered to be sharp with \"faithful\" color reproduction, but too dim for use in bright sunlight. Its camera was panned for producing images that lacked the sharpness of its competitors, but the camera software itself was still noted for its advanced options and Zoe shooting mode. The HTC One's user interface was considered cleaner and closer to the stock Android design than previous releases, while BlinkFeed was considered to be \"slick\" and \"useful\", yet \"far from original\". Some of HTC's changes to the Android UI were criticized, including its \"cramped\" on-screen keyboard, and its deviation from the common three-key button layout used by other manufacturers.<ref name=anandtech-review/> Calore also criticized HTC for shipping the phone with Android 4.1.2 when Android 4.2 had been released three months prior to its official announcement. These factors, along with unsatisfactory battery life experienced by Calore, prompted him to give the HTC One a rating of 7.0 out of 10.<ref name=wired-htcone>{{cite web | last=Olivarez-Giles | first=Nathan | title=HTC One: The Finest One Yet | url=https://www.wired.com/reviews/2013/04/htc-one/all/ | work=Wired | publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications | date=8 April 2013 | accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe One's industrial design and camera were also praised by both ''[[CNET]]'' (who gave the phone a 4 out of 5) and ''[[PC Magazine]]'' (who gave the phone an Excellent rating); however, ''PC Magazine'' criticized the inability to properly perform digital cropping and zooming on images taken with the camera, along with the non-removable \"bloatware\" applications added by AT&T in its version. ''CNET'' panned BlinkFeed for its lack of content sources and for not being able to use custom sources or turn it off completely, but praised the updates to Sense and the TV app. Again, the \"bloatware\" added by Sprint and AT&T was criticized, but HTC's placement of carrier apps in their own separate folder in the application drawer was noted.<ref name=\"cnet-review\">{{cite web | url=http://reviews.cnet.com/htc-one/ | title=HTC One Review | last=Bennett | first=Brian | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=CNET | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822155853/http://reviews.cnet.com/htc-one/ | archivedate=22 August 2013 | url-status=live | date=3 June 2013 | accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"pcmag-review\">{{cite web | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2418310,00.asp | title=HTC One (AT&T) Review | last=Segan | first=Sascha | publisher=Ziff Davis | work=PC Magazine | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502203703/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2418310,00.asp | archivedate=2 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=30 April 2013 | accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Sales ===\n\nOn 23 May 2013, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that sales of the HTC One had reached around 5 million since its launch in March.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/htc-one-5-million-sold/ | title=HTC One approaching 5 million units sold | last=Berenbaum | first=Saul | publisher=Designtechnica | work=Digital Trends | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912192154/http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/htc-one-5-million-sold/ |archivedate=12 September 2013 | url-status=live | date=23 May 2013 | accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> By comparison, the iPhone 5 sold 5 million units within its first three days of availability<ref name=\"Sales top 5 million\">{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/story/2012/09/24/first-week-of-iphone-5-sales/57834504/1 | title=Apple: Weekend sales top 5 million for iPhone 5 | last=Graham | first=Jefferson | work=USA Today | publisher=Gannett Company | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011012935/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/story/2012/09/24/first-week-of-iphone-5-sales/57834504/1 | archivedate=11 October 2012 | url-status=live | date=24 September 2012 | accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> and the Galaxy S4 shipped 10 million units within its first month of availability.<ref name=\"tr-onesales\">{{cite web | url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/5-million-htc-one-sales-is-good-news-for-taiwanese-firm-1153777 | title=5 million HTC One sales is good news for Taiwanese firm | last=McCann | first=John | publisher=Future plc | work=TechRadar | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912192427/http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/5-million-htc-one-sales-is-good-news-for-taiwanese-firm-1153777 | archivedate=12 September 2013 | url-status=live | date=23 May 2013 | accessdate=23 May 2013}}</ref> While not quoting any further numbers, Mark Woodward, president of HTC's North American division, considered the HTC One's launch to have been the most successful in the company's history.

(operating system)|Android]] [[smartphone]] designed, developed, and manufactured by [[HTC]]. The smartphone was unveiled on 19 February 2013 at press events in New York City and London and is HTC's seventh flagship smartphone.<ref name=HTCflagships>{{cite web|last=Nield|first=David|title=Path of the One|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/path-of-the-one-the-headline-hits-and-flagship-flops-from-htc-1236414#articleContent|publisher=TechRadar|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref> It is the successor to the company's 2012 flagship model, the [[HTC One X|One X]]\u2014which was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful due in part to insufficient marketing efforts. To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a [[Monocoque|unibody]] aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom [[image sensor]] and the ability to automatically generate [[Montage (filmmaking)|montages]] of media, an updated version of HTC's [[HTC Sense|Sense user experience]], BlinkFeed\u2014an [[news aggregator|aggregator]] of news and social network content, and an [[electronic program guide]] app with the ability to serve as a [[universal remote]] via an [[infrared blaster|IR blaster]] located in the device's power button.\n\nBeginning in March 2013, the HTC One was made available to mobile operators and major retailers in at least 181 countries. Manufacturing delays led to a staggered release beginning in late March, with its release date in certain markets (such as Asia and North America) pushed to late-April. Nevertheless, with around 5 million units being sold during its first two months of worldwide availability, HTC stated that the One was the most successful launch in the company's history.<ref name=atd-onemini/><ref name=tr-onesales/>\n\nThe HTC One was praised for the quality of its [[industrial design]], high-density 468 [[pixel density|ppi]] display, and high-power 2.6[[audio power|W RMS]] stereo sound system, and was well-received for its overall performance and improved [[user experience]] in comparison to earlier HTC devices. However, some aspects of the device, such as its photo quality, battery life, and certain elements of the device's operating system, were subject to scrutiny by critics. The device has received numerous awards and accolades, including being named \"Best New Mobile Device\" by the [[GSM Association]] at [[Mobile World Congress]] 2013, and was named the best smartphone of 2013 at the same conference one year later. It was succeeded by the [[HTC One (M8)]] on 25 March 2014.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\nAlthough HTC has developed several notable Android devices, such as the [[HTC Dream|Dream]]\u2014the first publicly released Android device, it failed to capitalize on the [[first-mover advantage]], and has struggled financially in recent years due to the increasing market share captured by other vendors such as [[Samsung]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].

The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap [[injection molding]]. The polycarbonate forms a band around the edge of the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a [[loop antenna]] for the One's [[near field communication]] (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision [[Numerical control|CNC cutting]] to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.\n\nTwo capacitive navigation keys, \"Back\" and \"Home\", are located below the display, flanked by HTC's logo in the center. While other recent HTC devices (such as the [[HTC One X|One X]]) used a three-key layout with \"Back\", \"Home\", and \"Recent apps\" keys, HTC designers believed that using only two navigation keys as opposed to three would reduce user confusion. As with other HTC devices lacking a hardware \"Menu\" key (as per revised Android [[human interface guidelines]] introduced in 2012, which [[deprecation|deprecate]] their use), apps that have not been updated to reflect the newer guidelines display a \"Menu\" button on a black bar on the bottom of the screen.<ref name=\"engadget-design\">{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-hands-on-design-and-hardware/ | title=HTC One hands-on: design and hardware | last=Joire | first=Myriam | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822214309/http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-hands-on-design-and-hardware/ | archivedate=22 August 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=anandtech-review/>\n\n=== Hardware ===\n\nThe HTC One uses a 4.7 inch, [[1080p]] [[Super LCD]] 3 touchscreen display with a [[pixel density]] of 468 ppi.<ref name=\"pcmag-handson\">{{cite web | last=Colon | first=Alex | last2=Segan|first2= Sascha | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2415574,00.asp | title=Hands On With the HTC One | publisher=Ziff Davis | work=PC Magazine | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511135338/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2415574,00.asp | archivedate=11 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> The backside of the device houses the camera, the LED flash, and the secondary microphone.

Most high-end smartphones at the time of its release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0&nbsp;\u00b5m, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One's UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of [[dynamic range]] and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments.<ref name=anandtech-review/><ref name=\"cnet-4mp\">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569991-94/htc-explains-why-4-megapixels-are-better-than-8 | title=HTC explains why 4 megapixels are better than 8 | last=Westaway | first=Luke | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=CNET | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511023707/http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569991-94/htc-explains-why-4-megapixels-are-better-than-8/| archivedate=11 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> The camera also includes [[optical image stabilization]], and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 [[image processor]].<ref name=\"verge-unveiled\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/19/4003728/htc-one-launch-announcement | title=HTC One announced: a 4.7-inch, 1080p Android flagship with an 'UltraPixel' camera | last=Savov | first=Vlad | publisher=Vox Media | work=The Verge | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521204139/http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/19/4003728/htc-one-launch-announcement |archivedate=21 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=engadget-zoe/>\n\nIn September 2013, HTC confirmed \"isolated reports\" of users experiencing a purple or red tint with the camera in low-light conditions.

Four shortcuts to frequently used applications can be stored on a dock at the bottom of the screen; the button in the center of the dock opens the application drawer, which displays a menu containing all of the applications installed on the device. A notifications tray accessible by pulling from the top of the screen allows users to view notifications received from other apps, as well as enable the One's \"Power Saver\" mode.\n\nPre-loaded applications on the HTC One provide access to [[Google applications|Google's various services]], including [[Google Play]], which can be used to download and purchase apps, music, movies, and e-books. Other pre-installed apps on the HTC One include a browser with [[Adobe Flash]] support, Calendar, Contacts, [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Facebook]], FM Radio, [[Google Chrome for Android]], Kid Mode, Music, Notes, [[Polaris Office]], [[SoundHound]], Tasks, [[TuneIn]] Radio, and Weather (data provided by [[AccuWeather]]).<ref name=anandtech-review/> The recent apps menu, which displays nine recently opened apps on a grid of thumbnails, is accessed by double-tapping the Home key, while [[Google Search]] is accessed by long-pressing the key. As with previous devices in its series, and adhering to its official [[deprecation]] in [[Android Honeycomb|Android 3.0]], the HTC One does not include a \"Menu\" button. By default, apps which are not specifically built for Android 3.0 or later display a virtual menu key on a black bar at the bottom of the screen; this black bar is removable in Android 4.2.2 and later if users choose to enable the \"Menu\" key functionality by long-pressing the \"Home\" key.<ref name=\"anandtech-one422update\"/>\n\nThe HTC One shipped with [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.1.2 \"Jelly Bean\"]] and version 5.0 of HTC's proprietary [[HTC Sense|Sense]] software suite. In comparison to previous versions of the software, Sense 5 uses a flat, minimalist visual style with refreshed icons and the condensed variant of the [[Roboto]] font family. Instead of a traditional home screen display with apps and widgets, Sense 5 defaults to a screen known as BlinkFeed, a [[news aggregator]] which displays a scrolling grid of news headlines from selected sources (as syndicated by Mobiles Republic) and [[social networking service|social network]] content in a similar fashion to [[Flipboard]] and [[Windows Phone]]\u2019s live tiles. New content is synchronized every two hours when connected to a mobile network, but more frequently while on Wi-Fi.<ref name=anandtech-review/><ref name=engadget-handsonui/> Directly above the BlinkFeed display is a clock which displays the user\u2019s local time and weather forecast; the signature [[flip clock]] widget seen on previous HTC devices was replaced by a simpler digital clock for Sense 5. Hundreds of different clock designs by HTC\u2019s designers, narrowed down to 25, were considered before the final design was chosen. As with previous versions of Sense, users can still add or remove pages on the home screen for housing app shortcuts and widgets; one such page is provided by default, and which page to display by default can be set by the user. However, BlinkFeed will always occupy the leftmost page of the home screen.<ref name=\"cnet-sensereboot\">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569700-94/htc-one-reboots-sense-and-hopes-for-a-comeback/ | title=HTC One reboots Sense and hopes for a comeback | last=Cheng | first=Roger | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=CNET | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304182100/http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569700-94/htc-one-reboots-sense-and-hopes-for-a-comeback/ | archivedate=4 March 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-handsonui\">{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-software-hands-on-sense-5-blinkfeed-sense-tv-and-new/ | title=HTC One software hands-on: Sense 5, BlinkFeed, Sense TV and new Sync Manager | last=Lai | first=Richard | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304144949/http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/19/htc-one-software-hands-on-sense-5-blinkfeed-sense-tv-and-new/ | archivedate=4 March 2013 | url-status=live | date=19 February 2013 | accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> The application drawer uses a 3x4 grid to display application shortcuts by default, but can still be changed back to the denser 4x5 grid used by past versions.

Individual frames can be saved from the clip, while the frames can also be used with other editing features such as Sequence Shot (which superimposes multiple frames into a composite image). Photos taken in Zoe mode are also displayed with animated thumbnails in the gallery. The Highlights feature can automatically generate a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage video]] from photos and videos with multiple theme and soundtrack options.

The upgrade also added the ability to show the current battery percentage on the status bar, more consistent behavior for the home key, allows the removal of icons from the home screen's dock, allows the Home key to serve as the deprecated \"Menu\" key in certain apps by long-pressing (in lieu of displaying it on a black bar on-screen), allows [[Google Now]] to be accessed by swiping up from the home button, and adds support for displaying widgets on the lock screen (however, unlike stock Android, only one widget can be placed on the lock screen at a time).<ref name=\"anandtech-one422update\">{{cite web | url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7128/android-422-update-for-htc-one-rollout-begins-we-take-a-look | title=Android 4.2.2 Update Rollout for HTC One Begins - We Take a Look | last=Klug | first=Brian | publisher=Anandtech Inc. | work=Anandtech | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912185153/http://www.anandtech.com/show/7128/android-422-update-for-htc-one-rollout-begins-we-take-a-look |archivedate=12 September 2013 | url-status=live | date=8 July 2013 | accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-htcone422\">{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/01/htc-one-android-4-2-2-update/ | title=HTC One Android 4.2.2 update adds UI features, sticks with Sense 5.0 | last=Trew | first=James | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812165927/http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/01/htc-one-android-4-2-2-update/ | archivedate=12 August 2013 |url-status=live | date=1 June 2013 | accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn North America, Android 4.2.2 was only available as the pre-loaded software on Verizon Wireless' HTC One, since HTC considered 4.2 to be relatively minor on smartphones.

In combination with its stereo speakers, the One was considered a good phone for viewing videos and playing games, while its call quality was judged as being sufficient. In regards to performance, the HTC One was considered to be \"an impressively powerful phone across the board\" due to its high scores on various [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark tests]]. Its camera received mixed reviews; while it had better low-light performance than its competitors as advertised, the One's photos were criticized for looking \"soft and mushy\" due to extensive post-processing and only looked relatively good at the smaller sizes applied by services such as [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]].

The display was considered to be sharp with \"faithful\" color reproduction, but too dim for use in bright sunlight. Its camera was panned for producing images that lacked the sharpness of its competitors, but the camera software itself was still noted for its advanced options and Zoe shooting mode. The HTC One's user interface was considered cleaner and closer to the stock Android design than previous releases, while BlinkFeed was considered to be \"slick\" and \"useful\", yet \"far from original\". Some of HTC's changes to the Android UI were criticized, including its \"cramped\" on-screen keyboard, and its deviation from the common three-key button layout used by other manufacturers.<ref name=anandtech-review/> Calore also criticized HTC for shipping the phone with Android 4.1.2 when Android 4.2 had been released three months prior to its official announcement.

It marked the culmination of the [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the third edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], but was the first time a final had been held; both the previous events had been [[round-robin tournament]]s. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|the inaugural tournament in 1973]], while Australia won [[1978 Women's Cricket World Cup|in 1978]]. Australia won the match [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|by three wickets]] to claim their second world title.\n\nAustralia and England won finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. Australia had gone unbeaten throughout the round-robin, having won eleven of their matches and [[Tie (cricket)|tied]] with England in the other. England had won seven of their matches, lost three and tied twice, and finished 14 points behind Australia and 6 ahead of New Zealand. The final was [[Umpire (cricket)|umpired]] by [[Dickie Bird]] and [[Fred Goodall]]. England [[Batting (cricket)|batted]] first in the final, and scored slowly, particularly against Australia's [[spin bowling]]. [[Jan Southgate]] top-scored for England with 53 [[Run (cricket)|runs]], as they made 151 for five. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing their first three wickets for 28 runs. A [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] between [[Karen Read]] and [[Sharon Tredrea]] recovered their [[innings]], before quick scoring from [[Jen Jacobs]] and [[Marie Cornish]] saw them to victory.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the third [[Women's Cricket World Cup]].
